Since both treatments are safe in pregnancy, many physicians are using ondansetron as first line in practice. Despite this practice and the recommendations from ACOG, there is not data to suggest that ether practice is superior. This will be the first prospective, randomized, double blind, controlled trial comparing the two treatments. We hypothesize that ondansetron will be equally efficacious in reducing nausea and episodes of emesis.

Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with Sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP), the administration of SP at predefined intervals in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy irrespective of the presence of malaria parasitemia, is currently recommended for HIV-negative women in all areas with stable moderate to high transmission of malaria. Due to increasing resistance to SP, it is no longer used as a treatment for symptomatic malaria, and the efficacy of IPTp-SP seems to be decreased. This study aims to look at a new drug, Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) for IPTp, as well as to explore the strategy of intermittent screening and treatment in pregnancy (ISTp) with DP. This strategy uses increased screening at time of focused antenatal care (FANC) with treatment of women who screen positive.~The hypothesis is that the efficacy of both IPTp-DP and ISTp-DP will be associated with a reduction in malaria infection at delivery among HIV(-) women when compared to IPTp-SP, in an area with decreasing malaria transmission and high levels of SP resistance in Kenya._Female_N/A_N/A_Conditions:  pregnancy~malaria_Inclusion Criteria:~Viable pregnancy assessed by Doppler~Gestational age 16 to 32 weeks (inclusive) by fundal height~No history of IPTp use during this pregnancy~Willing to participate and complete the study schedule~Willing to sign or thumb print informed consent~Resident of study area and intending to stay in the area for the duration of the follow-up~Willing to deliver in the labor ward of the study clinic or hospital~HIV negative at enrolment~Exclusion Criteria:~HIV positive or unknown~Residence outside study area or planning to move out in the 12 months following enrolment~High risk pregnancy, including any pre-existing illness likely to cause complication of pregnancy (hypertension, diabetes, asthma, epilepsy, renal disease, liver disease, fistula repair, leg or spine deformity)~Severe anemia requiring blood transfusion (Hb ≤ 7.0 g/dL) at enrolment~Known allergy or previous adverse reaction to any of the study drugs~Unable to give informed consent (for example due to mental disability)~Previous inclusion in the same study~Gestational age >32 weeks~Previous IPTp during the current pregnancy~Participating in other malaria intervention studies~Known or suspected cardiac disease~Patients taking drugs in any of the following classes: antiarrhythmic agents, neuroleptics, macrolides, and certain antimalarial drugs such as mefloquine, chloroquine, halofantrine and lumefantrine."

"8","NCT03029702_Metabolic Analysis for Treatment Choice in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus_Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a significant clinical and public health burden, affecting over 400,000 pregnant women in the United States each year. Without adequate treatment, women with GDM and their infants are at risk for substantial morbidity. Because of this, experts recommend treatment focused on normalization of hyperglycemia to improve outcomes. However, providers have limited capacity to predict which treatment will achieve glycemic goals. This results in a choice based on provider and patient preference and a trial and error approach, which can create delays in glycemic control within the short (8-10 weeks) window between diagnosis and delivery. Maternal and fetal morbidity may be related to a mismatch between glycemic pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of glucose-lowering agents. In fact, GDM is heterogeneous, with predominant insulin resistance (IR) in 50%, insulin secretion deficit (ISD) in 30%, and a combination of both in 20% of women as underlying mechanisms of hyperglycemia. This variation in GDM pathophysiology and clinical outcomes supports the use of an individualized treatment approach. The overall goal of this project is to investigate an individualized treatment approach for GDM where treatment is based on each woman's GDM mechanism. The study will employ the same treatment in both arms, but choice of treatment will differ based on study arm (matched or unmatched to GDM mechanism)._Female_18 Years_45 Years_Conditions:  gestational diabetes~diabetes, gestational~pregnancy in diabetes_Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant women beyond 24 weeks of gestation who are scheduled for a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test.~Exclusion Criteria:~Fetal anomaly~Pregestational diabetes~GDM diagnosis without a 3-hour OGTT~Multifetal gestation~Treatment with non-inhaled steroids within 7 days~Allergy to glyburide, metformin or sulfa~History of severe pulmonary (pulmonary requirement for oxygen therapy or daily treatment for restrictive of obstructive pulmonary disease)~Hepatic (LFT's greater than two times of upper normal range)~Renal (serum creatinine higher than 1.2 mg/dL) disease~History of heart failure or myocardial infarction"

"15","NCT04871425_Ketamine Versus Fentanyl for Surgical Abortions: A Randomized Controlled Noninferiority Trial_Ketamine is commonly used for procedural sedation and analgesia. It is widely used for trauma cases in the emergency department and is considered a superior agent in the outpatient setting due to its lack of respiratory and cardiovascular depression. In chronic opioid users, ketamine decreases acute pain and reduces postoperative opioid consumption. Few studies have examined the use of ketamine for surgical abortions. Previous studies found significant rates of emergence phenomena; however, this can be prevented if a benzodiazepine is given at the same time. Ketamine deserves further study to determine whether it is an acceptable alternative to a standard opioid-based regimen for surgical abortion. Our primary objective is to compare patient satisfaction after surgical abortion among patients receiving IV ketamine versus IV fentanyl for procedural sedation. Our secondary objectives include postoperative pain, additional pain medication used, and postoperative opioid use after the procedure. Our hypothesis is that ketamine will provide similar patient satisfaction and reduce postoperative opioid use. This will be a randomized controlled noninferiority clinical trial of 84 women receiving either IV ketamine with IV midazolam or IV fentanyl with IV midazolam for outpatient one day surgical abortions up to 13, 6/7 weeks gestation. Both groups will receive a standardized paracervical block and additional pain medication as needed. Our study has the potential to introduce IV ketamine as a satisfactory medication for outpatient surgical abortions. Ketamine may decrease the need for IV fentanyl, reduce postoperative opioid use, and may prove to be a superior analgesic for chronic opioid users._Female_14 Years_N/A_Conditions:  abortion in first trimester~pain, procedural~opioid use_Inclusion Criteria:~Aged 14 years or older~Voluntarily requesting surgical pregnancy termination~Intrauterine pregnancy up to 13 weeks 6 days by transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasound performed on day of procedure~Eligible for suction curettage~English or Spanish speaking~Able and willing to give informed consent and agree to terms of the study~Exclusion Criteria:~Age less than 14 years~Reaspiration procedure or failed medication abortion~Early pregnancy loss~Alcohol use disorder or acute alcohol intoxication~Currently incarcerated~Gestational age 14 weeks or more~Requesting a specific pain regimen~Premedication with misoprostol~Contraindications or allergies to ketamine or fentanyl"

After initiating epidural analgesia, there are many epidural drug regimens that can be employed to maintain analgesia for the duration of labour using an epidural catheter. Due to recent advances in medical technology, new epidural pumps, which allow both patient controlled epidural analgesia boluses (PCEA, a common standard of care in many hospitals) and programmed intermittent epidural boluses (PIEB, automatic boluses given in addition to the PCEA bolus), are now available. In this randomized double-blind trial, we aim to evaluate the effects of different combinations of PIEB (epidural bolus volume) and PIEB (bolus volume and time interval) on labour patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) usage. In theory, the more effective the PIEB combination (the ideal drug volume and ideal time interval), the less PCEA boluses (extra epidural drug) will be used as well as less clinician boluses and less lower limb weakness (motor block) as assessed by the Bromage Score._Female_18 Years_50 Years_Conditions:  labor pain~obstetric pain~analgesia_Inclusion Criteria:~Age 18 to 50 yrs~In active labour~ASA 2 patients (pregnant patients are considered to be ASA 2)~Singleton pregnancy~> 37 weeks gestation~Booking BMI 18 to 35~Exclusion Criteria:~BMI < 18~BMI > 35~Systemic opioids within the previous 6 hours~Presence of a fetal anomaly~Pre-eclampsia~Bleeding disorders (including coagulation disorders)~Recent spinal surgery~Spinal injury~Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)~Neuraxial disorders of any description~Signs of local or systemic infection~Patient refusal for neuraxial analgesia"

"30","NCT01192035_PI or NNRTI as First-line Treatment of HIV in a West African Population With Low Adherence - the PIONA Trial_BACKGROUND: Since 1996 the combination of three or more drugs has been the mainstay of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. The most important types of drugs are called nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) Response to treatment is measured as increasing CD4+ cell count and decreasing HIV viral load. A major problem is the development of resistance. NNRTIs are recommended as part of first-line treatment of HIV in Africa but many Africans have a slower NNRTI clearance than Caucasians making them more susceptible for development of resistance in case of treatment interruptions. PIs might therefore be a better option in an African setting with low adherence.~AIM: To evaluate two different treatment regimens in HIV-1 infected patients:~A) A NNRTI (efavirenz/nevirapine) based regimen and B) A PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir) based regimen with regard to treatment outcomes. HYPOTHESIS: Treatment with a PI will be superior to treatment with a NNRTI due to less development of resistance.~METHODS: Treatment-naïve adult HIV-1 patients enrolled in an existing cohort The West African Retrovirus and Acquired Immune Deficiency (WARAID) cohort in Guinea Bissau with CD4+ cell count ≤ 350 cells/µL and/or clinical signs of immune suppression (World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage 3 or 4) will be randomised 1:1 to: Treatment A: 2 NRTIs (lamivudine and either zidovudine or stavudine) and 1 NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine) or Treatment B: 2 NRTIs (same as in treatment A) and 1 PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir). Primary outcome: Viral load suppression <400 copies/ml 12 months after enrolment.~PERSPECTIVES: Guidelines for treatment of HIV in Africa are more or less a copy of the guidelines used in Europe and North America. Genetic differences in pharmacokinetics, more women infected in Africa and difficulties ensuring good adherence mean that results obtained from Caucasian patients are not directly transferrable to African patients. The results of this study will hopefully help guiding the treatment of HIV in Africa in the future. The investigators believe the HIV infected people in West Africa deserve the same evidence-based medicine as in developed countries._All_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  hiv-1_Inclusion Criteria:~Antiretroviral treatment (ART) naïve HIV-1 infected patients.

"31","NCT01519765_Buccal Versus Vaginal Misoprostol for Third Trimester Induction of Labor: Randomized Control Trial_Approximately 22% of term pregnancies are induced. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, is a widely accepted induction agent, that has been proven safe and effective for induction of labor. It stimulates both cervical ripening and uterine contractions, thus making it an ideal induction agent for unfavorable cervices. Research has examined the pharmacokinetics of different administration routes and effects on uterine contractility, side effects, and safety. Vaginal misoprostol has been shown to be superior over oral administration however patients often prefer a more tolerable route. Buccal administration has already been shown to be as effective as vaginal misoprostol for cervical ripening and induction in both first trimester and second trimester abortions. There is minimal research comparing buccal versus vaginal for third trimester induction of labor. The investigators study is a prospective, double blinded, randomized control trial comparing vaginal misoprostol and buccal misoprostol in equal dosages of 25 mcg.

"36","NCT01746199_Comparative Study of Efficacy of Two Antifolates Prophylactic Strategies Against Malaria in HIV Positive Pregnant Women (MACOMBA Study)_Given the resistance emergence of malaria in pregnant women receiving intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPT-SP) and the burden of this infection among pregnant women infected by HIV it is urgent to seek a more effective alternative treatment to optimize the prevention of malaria. Cotrimoxazole (CTM), actually administered daily as a prophylactic mean to opportunistic infections for HIV infected patients, showed encouraging results in preventing malaria in pregnant women. However, these results must be confirmed by randomized trials, particularly in pregnant women.~The main objective of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of cotrimoxazole (CTM), administered once daily with IPT-SP (3 curative doses spaced one month) on placental parasitaemia in pregnant women infected with HIV and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) > 350 cells/mm3.~The main hypothesis is based on the premise that cotrimoxazole is more effective than IPT-SP for placental parasitaemia. This might be due to the higher plasma concentration of cotrimoxazole attained with daily doses. If this hypothesis is proven, cotrimoxazole could be recommended as prophylaxis for HIV-positive pregnant women, whatever their CD4+ cell count. In this study, the investigators will also test the hypothesis that the strains of Plasmodium falciparum isolated from HIV-positive pregnant women express more dhfr and dhps resistance markers._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  malaria in pregnancy~hiv infection_Inclusion Criteria:~age ≥ 18 years~HIV positivity~gestational age between 16 and 28 weeks~CD4+ count > 350 cells/mm3 and no sign of WHO stage 2, 3 or 4;~agreement to attend all the antenatal consultations for the study~willingness to adhere to all requirements of the study (including HIV-1 voluntary counseling and testing)~signed informed consent~Exclusion Criteria:~psychological instability that could interfere with compliance;~hypersensitivity to sulfamides or dermatological disease(eczema, pemphigoid exanthema) that would increase the risk for severe reactions to the drugs being tested~severe anaemia (Hb<7 g/dl)and any other severe disease~known hepatic cardiac or renal disease"

"49","NCT01810354_PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS PRIOR TO CESAREAN SECTION IN OBESE WOMEN: Does Increasing the Dose Increase the Tissue Concentration?_Surgical site infections are common and a cause of major morbidity. They are also more common in obese women. Cesarean sections are the most common surgery performed in the United States, therefore pregnant women are being faced with this problem frequently. There is evidence to show that prophylactically administered antibiotics, cefazolin specifically, to obese women prior to cesarean section do not reach adequate concentrations in adipose tissue to prevent infection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if an increased dose of cefazolin will attain adequate tissue concentration in obese women. Our hypothesis is that three grams of cefazolin given no more than 60 minutes prior to the start of a cesarean section in an obese (Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30) woman will attain adequate adipose tissue concentration compared to two grams of cefazolin.~Subjects will be selected if they are greater than 37 weeks gestation wiht a singleton pregnancy and require a cesarean section for any obstetrical indication. Women will be excluded if they have a suspected infection, have a multiple gestation, or have preexisting diabetes or hypertension with end organ damage. The subjects will be screened both by through the OR schedule as well as through the clinics. They will then be consented and enrolled by the primary investigator. Once enrolled the subjects will be randomized to receive either two grams or three grams of cefazolin as prophylactic antibiotics to be given no more than 60 minutes prior to the start of the surgery.~Two adipose tissue samples will be obtained at the time of surgery. The first at the start after skin incision and the second at the end prior to closure of the skin. There will also be a separate IV placed at the start of the procedure from which three blood draws can be collected. These three samples will be obtained at the start of the surgery but after antibiotic administration, at the time of the first adipose collection, and at the time of the second adipose collection. The samples will then be stored at -80 degrees and shipped to David P. Nicolau's lab in Hartford, CT for the tissue and serum analysis.~While the subjects are in the hospital recovering from their surgery, a chart review will be performed to determine if there are any infections occuring post-operatively. A telephone survey will be conducted six to eight weeks postpartum again assessing for any infectious complications after the cesarean section._Female_N/A_N/A_Conditions:  infection prevention_Inclusion Criteria:~Obese - body mass index (BMI) calculated as weight (kg)/ [height (m2)]greater than or equal to 30 as determined at their first prenatal visit~Gestational age of 37 0/7 weeks and greater~Singleton Pregnancy~Non-emergent cesarean section~Exclusion Criteria:~Known cephalosporin allergy~Severe allergy to penicillin making cephalosporin use a contraindication~Exposure to antibiotics in the preceding 7 days~Need for emergent cesarean section~Multiple gestations~Suspected chorioamnionitis~Pre-gestational diabetes~Chronic hypertension with evidence of end organ damage"

"62","NCT01904500_Peri-operative Cefazolin Prophylaxis at Time of Cesarean Delivery in the Obese Gravida_Obesity has become an increasingly prevalent public health problem in the United States, reaching epidemic proportions. According to 2009 CDC epidemiologic data on obesity in the United States, 35.7% of the United States population is considered overweight or obese. Currently, on the review of the literature, over 20% of pregnancies in this country are complicated by maternal obesity. Obesity has been well demonstrated to be correlated with numerous adverse pregnancy outcomes such hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and increased rates of operative delivery. Moreover, obesity, irrespective of pregnancy, has been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for the development of postoperative surgical site infections. Development of such infections can have both consequential long-term medical sequelae for patients and economic impacts on the health care system at large. Cefazolin, a first generation hydrophilic cephalosporin whose clearance is exclusively mediated via the kidneys unchanged, is used as pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis for cesarean deliveries. The current accepted standard of care is to administer 2 grams of cefazolin within 60 minutes of skin incision. Studies of drug concentrations of cephalosporins for pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis in obese bariatric patients have shown that therapeutic concentrations may not be achieved in both tissue and plasma. Limited data exist in pregnancy. Therefore, it is the goal of this study to investigate whether obese patients presenting for cesarean delivery require an increased dosing amount of pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. This study will randomized women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or more who are presenting for their scheduled cesarean delivery to receive either 2 grams or 3 grams of cefazolin for pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis.

However, SD NVP may cause NVP resistance in the mother, potentially ruling out some treatment options in the future. The purpose of this study is to determine which of three anti-HIV drug regimens most effectively reduces the development of maternal NVP resistance in HIV infected pregnant women. The effectiveness of short-term (7 day therapy) versus long-term (21-day therapy) regimens will also be compared.~The study hypotheses are: 1) intrapartum SD NVP with a 21-day course of antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in less frequent selection of NVP-resistant HIV-1 variants than intrapartum SD NVP with a 7-day course of ART, and 2) a 7- or 21-day course of lamivudine/zidovudine (3TC/ZDV), emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF), or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) following SD NVP will not select nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)- or protease inhibitor (PI)- resistant HIV-1 variants._Female_13 Years_N/A_Conditions:  hiv infections_Inclusion Criteria for Mothers:~HIV-1 infected~CD4 count 250 cells/mm3 or greater within 30 days of study entry~The following laboratory values obtained within 30 days prior to study entry: absolute neutropil count >= 750/mm3; hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dL; platelet count >= 50,000/mm3; calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault formula) > 60 mL/min; AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) < 5 x ULN; total bilirubin < 1.5 X ULN.~Pregnant with a viable fetus at 28 to 38 weeks gestation at study entry.~Willing to give birth to baby in a hospital or clinic~Written informed consent from parent or guardian, if applicable~Exclusion Criteria for Mothers:~Any ART, including single-dose NVP, prior to study entry.

"71","NCT03727971_Use of Omalizumab Will Increase the Pregnancy Rate, Proof of Concept Study, Where Women With Asthma and Infertility Will be Treated Three Times With Weight and IgE Balanced Dosis at the First Day of Their Period Bleeding_The investigators have previously confirmed a clinical hunch that women with asthma have difficulties in becoming pregnant. The investigators found increased time to pregnancy (TTP) in women with asthma compared to non-asthmatic women (55 vs 33 months, p<0.001), furthermore, women with asthma had less successful pregnancies following fertility treatment (39.6 vs 60.4%, p=0.002). Treatment with omalizumab stabilizes the eosinophilic disease, through the systemic and most likely the anti-inflammatory pathways, which indicate a promising possibility to increase pregnancy rate. In a small real-life study in 2017, 5 patients with eosinophilic asthma who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF), were treated with omalizumab prior to embryo transplantation; three out of the five women became pregnant. Lastly, the two remaining patients had several treatments with omalizumab, but did not become pregnant. This real-life study calls for further investigation. By targeting systemic inflammation with omalizumab treatment the aim is to increase asthma control before and during pregnancy. A treatment strategy aiming at improving overall inflammatory control may increase fertility, but also reduce well known maternal and perinatal adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low-birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), preterm delivery.~Study design:~A randomized control trial with omalizumab and placebo, stratified for blood eosinophil count, is therefore needed. A randomized, double blinded, parallel group, study to evaluate the difference between omalizumab (O) and placebo (P) on pregnancy rate in patients with atopic asthma.Treatment schedule: After collection of material (blood samples, sputum) 6th day (±1 day) of the menstrual cycle, the patients will be randomized in either the omalizumab group or the placebo group. No collection of material will be done at the time of enrollment, as this will be on different time of the female cycles. The treatment is initiated with one injection with weight and serum-immunglobulin E balanced omalizumab or one injection placebo. After omalizumab treatment at ovulation it will again be collected material (blood samples, sputum). If no pregnancy has occurred after first IVF cycle, this will be repeated for 3 consecutive IVF cycles in total or until pregnancy has occurred.~Outcome:~The primary out-come is efficacy of omalizumab, compared to placebo, in increasing pregnancy rate in females with asthma. Secondary out-comes are changes in the inflammation in lungs/systemic, pregnancy loss, asthma control and biomarkers in the blood/lungs._Female_18 Years_40 Years_Conditions:  asthma~infertility, female_Inclusion Criteria:~* Informed consent~Diagnosis of asthma~Infertility due to male factor infertility, tubal factor infertility or unexplained infertility.~Referred to IVF treatment with or without ICSI~Willingness to receive treatment with biologic drugs during menstruation period~Controlled disease with an ACQ ≤ 1.5~Exclusion criteria:~Other respiratory diseases than asthma~Other inflammatory disease or a disease that affects fertility.~Allergy to the investigational drugs~Respiratory infections requiring antibiotics or anti-viral treatment within 30 days~TESA / TESE, endometriosis~Infertility due to other reasons than male factor, tubal factor or unexplained infertility"

In obstetric patients, infectious morbidity (i.e. SSI, endometritis) occurs in 5-10% of cesarean sections, which is 5-fold higher than vaginal deliveries. Additionally, infectious morbidity is thought to be highest in those patients who have cesarean sections after undergoing labor.~Chlorhexidine, a chemical antiseptic effective on gram positive and gram negative bacteria, reduces skin microflora/colonization but it is not clear if it decreases the risk of SSI.~Historically, chlorhexidine has been studied and used in orthopedic and cardiac implant surgeries. Research on the use of chlorhexidine for SSI prevention in cesarean sections is limited. This study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of use of both chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) wipe and vaginal scrub in reducing SSI in patients undergoing cesarean section that have previously been laboring.

"76","NCT00811057_Tocolysis for Preterm Labor_Preterm birth is the most common and costly complication in obstetrics. It complicates up to 11% of all pregnancies and it is responsible for 70% of sick babies. The ideal way to stop preterm labor when it occurs (which drug to use) is not known. Currently magnesium sulfate is used by about 95% of all practitioners, but recent data suggest magnesium given this way may be harmful for the baby's future development. Other drugs such as antiprostaglandin agents are very effective in stopping uterine activity, but particularly when used for >48 hours have been associated with both maternal and fetal sides effects. Lastly, calcium channel antagonists are effective in stopping contractions and have very little in the way of maternal and fetal side effects, but less data is available in the United States on their use. Because there is no FDA approved drug to stop preterm labor, we purpose to randomize all women with preterm labor (20-34 weeks) to receive one of the above three methods of stopping preterm labor. The primary outcomes will be to see which agent stops the uterine contractions most effectively, for the longest period of time with fewest relapses and results in significant prolongation of pregnancy. If one of these agents is clearly superior to the other two it would help women avoid early delivery or have significant extension of their pregnancy to avoid some of the complications of preterm birth in the baby._Female_16 Years_45 Years_Conditions:  preterm labor_Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnancies with intact membranes in confirmed preterm labor;~20 - 32 weeks' gestation;~Cervical dilatation 0 - 3cm versus 4 - 6cm;~No conditions contraindicating continued pregnancy (severe IUGR, chorioamnionitis, non-reassuring fetal tracing - physician judgement); AND~Able and willing to consent to the study protocol.~Exclusion Criteria:~Failure to meet admission criteria;~Known serious fetal malformations;~Severe maternal/obstetric disease affecting the mother or fetus (severe cardiac disease, placental abruption/previa, severe diabetes, severe preeclampsia, etc. - physician judgment);~Allergic to magnesium, antiprostaglandin or calcium channel antagonist;~Refusal or inability to consent to the study"

"82","NCT00858832_Reduction of Endometritis After Cesarean Section With the Routine Use of Methergine_Endomyometritis is an infection in the uterus. It can occur in up to 1 out of 5 women having unplanned cesarean deliveries. Antibiotics are routinely given at the time of Cesarean delivery, but the infection in the uterus can still occur. When endomyometritis occurs it can prolong the woman's stay in the hospital after birth, slow down her recovery time at home, and increase medical costs. Methergine is a medication that is routinely used to stop uterine hemorrhage (excessive bleeding from the uterus) that sometimes happens after delivery. Methergine works by contracting (tightening) the uterus. These contractions also help the uterus to expel or remove parts of the placenta that increase the chance of developing a uterine infection.~This research study is being done to learn if routine use of Methergine can lower the chances of developing a uterine infection after cesarean delivery. Half of the women in this study will receive Methergine for a few days during their hospitalization after cesarean delivery.

Women have described the pain of osmotic dilator insertion as moderate to severe yet there have been few studies aimed at addressing pain during and after osmotic dilator insertion. In addition to the discomfort during insertion, pain after osmotic dilator insertion peaks at 2 hours post-insertion with use of a lidocaine paracervical block. One randomized trial found that use of a paracervical block with 1% buffered lidocaine decreased pain with osmotic dilator insertion compared to a sham block. There are adjunct treatments to optimize analgesia with local anesthetics at a variety of anatomic locations. Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, has been found to increase the quality of the anesthetic at the time of administration and increase the duration of nerve block analgesia at several anatomic sites, though has never been studied as an adjunct in a paracervical block. This has been used extensively in orthopedic surgery with significant prolongation of the local anesthetic effect by almost threefold in some studies.~Primary Aim: To compare the mean pain score at the time of osmotic dilator insertion among women randomized to a 1% lidocaine and buprenorphine paracervical block compared to a 1% lidocaine paracervical block alone.~Secondary Aim: To compare the mean pain score 2 hours after osmotic dilator insertion among women randomized to a lidocaine and buprenorphine paracervical block compared to a lidocaine paracervical block alone.~The investigators hypothesize that in patients undergoing osmotic dilator insertion in preparation for dilation and evacuation, the addition of buprenorphine 0.15mg to a 1% lidocaine paracervical block will be associated with lower mean pain scores at time of osmotic dilator insertion compared to women who receive a 1% lidocaine paracervical block alone._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  procedural pain~buprenorphine~adjuvants, anesthesia~dilation and evacuation~analgesics_Inclusion Criteria:~Gestational age 14 0/7 weeks to 23 6/7 weeks at time of osmotic dilator insertion~Require cervical preparation with placement of osmotic dilators~At least 18 years of age~Fluent in English or Spanish~Exclusion Criteria:~Same day dilation and evacuation procedure~Request for sedation during osmotic dilator insertion~Liver disease~Allergy to buprenorphine, lidocaine, or ibuprofen~Narcotic or opioid medication use in the preceding 24 hours~Use of recreational/illicit medications in the preceding 24 hours~Currently incarcerated"

Providers have traditionally delayed starting birth control, especially placement of intrauterine devices (IUDs), post-delivery for a number of reasons. The first postpartum visit after a woman has given birth is typically scheduled for 6 weeks after her delivery, during which she is typically provided with her chosen method of birth control. This study will evaluate two different IUD placement times: 3 weeks and 6 weeks after delivery. This will allow the researchers to determine if placement time affects a woman's follow-through obtaining the IUD and keeping it inserted in place.

"104","NCT04070573_A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Low Doses Of Aspirin In The Prevention Of Preeclampsia (ASAPP)_Preeclampsia (PE) is a morbid and potentially lethal complication of pregnancy and is more common in women with specific risk factors. Aspirin (ASA) is currently the only prophylactic therapy for preeclampsia in high-risk women to be recognized by the US Preventive Task Force and should be initiated early in the second trimester of pregnancy, before 16 weeks of gestation. However, currently there is no literature comparing various low-dose ASA formulations in the risk reduction of PE. In the United States, the currently available low-dose ASA is over the counter and is found in 81mg tablets. Therefore, when clinicians initiate therapy with low dose ASA, they may prescribe 1 or 2 tablets of 81mg aspirin per day depending on personal preference and cannot be assisted by evidence to guide their decision.This study aims to determine the incidence of preterm PE or PE with severe features in women taking either 81mg or 162mg in a randomized setting, from a single center. The investigators hypothesize that the information gained from this trial will permit a more accurate sample size calculation for a larger clinical trial powered to accept or reject our testing hypothesis. If our hypothesis is rejected and 162mg of daily ASA is not associated with a lower incidence of severe or preterm PE compared to 81mg, this may be due to lack of power to detect a smaller effect. The investigators would then evaluate the feasibility and results and determine whether a larger trial is reasonable._Female_18 Years_60 Years_Conditions:  preeclampsia_Patients are currently only being enrolled at the New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medicine and at the New York Presbyterian Queens campuses.~Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant patients, ≥18 years old, at less than 16 weeks' gestation (as documented by ultrasound) with at least one of the following risk factors for developing PE:~PE in a prior pregnancy~Chronic hypertension (prior to pregnancy or before 20 weeks' gestation)~Type 1 or 2 diabetes~Renal disease (proteinuria ≥300mg/day or estimated GFR<90mL/min/1.73 m2)~Multifetal gestation~Autoimmune disease (e.g. systemic lupus erythematous, antiphospholipid syndrome)~Exclusion Criteria:~Patient with known intention to terminate pregnancy~Major fetal malformation seen on ultrasound~Contraindication to ASA therapy (including but not limited to allergy and high bleeding risk)"

The investigators' study explores whether or not taking the anti-emetic ondansetron prior to doxycycline decreases rates of nausea/vomiting. Patients enrolled in the investigators' study will take either ondansetron or a placebo before they take doxycycline to see if ondansetron decreases their nausea/vomiting. Reducing nausea/vomiting may prevent more infections, and decrease the rates of general anesthesia, patient risks and hospital costs. Decreasing nausea/vomiting will also improve patient experience.~Study Design This will be a randomized controlled trial. Data will be collected by administrating surveys and a log where patients will record the timing of their medications and episodes of nausea/vomiting.

"112","NCT04783051_Comparison of IST Using Ultra-sensitive Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test and Pyronaridine - Artesunate - PYRAMAX®) to Standard IPT Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to Prevent Malaria in Pregnant Women Living in Endemic Areas_In endemic settings Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) can sequester in the placenta resulting in low peripheral parasitemia and false negative malaria diagnosis in pregnant women. Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnant women with Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is one of the World Health Organization's recommended malaria control strategies in sub-Saharan African countries. The strategy overcomes the risk of misdiagnosis of malaria in pregnant women by treating them all with SP according to predetermined schedules, but the strategy is now threatened by the spread of Plasmodium parasite resistant strains. As a necessary alternative, Intermittent Screening and Treatment in pregnancy (ISTp), aims on the monthly screening of pregnant women with a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and the treatment of positive cases with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) regardless of the presence of symptoms. The ISTp depends on the performance of the diagnostic tests, and the use of ultrasensitive RDTs (us-RDTs), which have a higher analytical sensitivity than conventional RDTs, should improve the efficacy of the strategy.~Unlike IPTp-SP, ISTp prevents overuse of antimalarials and thus limits drug pressure on malaria parasites. This advantage could be potentiated by using, for pregnant women, an ACT that is not yet used or should not be used in the field for other strata of the population. The recently approved new ACT combination, Pyronaridine - Artesunate (Pyramax®) is the ideal candidate for this purpose.~This study will compare the effects of the ISTp using an us-RDT and Pyramax® (ISTp-US-Py) with the standard IPTp-SP on maternal malaria indicators (malaria infection, parasite density), maternal anemia, spontaneous abortions or intrauterine deaths during pregnancy, fetal morbidity (preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age) and neonatal mortality at delivery in both study groups through conducting a randomized clinical trial enrolling second trimester pregnant women in Maternité Esengo Health Center, located in Kisenso, Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a malaria perennial transmission area.~The results generated from this study will be essential for the National Malaria Control Program in the selection and implementation of new malaria control policies and addresses the effectiveness of IPTp-SP decline among pregnant women in the DRC._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  malaria in pregnancy_Inclusion Criteria:~Gestation ≥16 weeks;~Age: ≥18 years;~Residence within the health facility catchment area;~Willing to adhere to study requirements and to deliver at the health facility.~Willing to provide written informed consent; if the woman is illiterate, she can choose an impartial witness, not related to the study, to accompany her during the informant consent process and they will both sign the informed consent form~Exclusion Criteria:~Known history of allergy to SP or to an ACT~An ongoing antibioprophylaxis with cotrimoxazole,~Current issue requiring hospital admission (including severe malaria as defined by WHO)~Pregnancy at high risk"

Even with augmented behavioral interventions, smoking cessation rates in pregnancy trials rarely exceed 20%. These low quit rates may be due to inadequate treatment of the physical dependence on nicotine. Indeed, medications, which may help to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms, are a first-line treatment for smoking treatment in non-pregnant smokers. However, little information is available on the safety or efficacy of medications to treat pregnant smokers.~The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 2 mg nicotine gum in promoting smoking cessation during pregnancy.

"128","NCT03553576_The Relationship Between Local Anesthetic Concentration and Volume on Adequate Labor Analgesia With Programmed Intermittent Epidural Bolus_Neuraxial labor analgesia is performed by the administration of a local anesthetic/opioid mixture in the epidural space. The delivery method is a combination of continuous infusion, provider-administered boluses and patient-administered boluses (patient controlled epidural analgesia [PCEA]) via epidural catheter. Pain during the first stage of labor is primarily due to lower uterine segment and cervical stretching. The pain signals enter the spinal cord through sensory nerves at the T10 through L1 dermatomes. Pain signals from the late first state and second stage of labor also arise from the vagina and perineum. These signals travel with the pudendal nerve and enter the spinal cord at S2-S4. Thus, the anesthetic solution administered through the lumbar epidural catheter must spread cephalad in the epidural space to reach the T10 nerve roots and spinal cord, and must spread caudad to reach the caudal nerve roots in the epidural space.~The optimal method for maintaining labor analgesia is unknown. Several studies have demonstrated that PIEB, in combination with PCEA, provide superior maintenance of labor analgesia (less need and longer time to provider intervention, lower local anesthetic consumption, less motor block, and improved patient satisfaction scores) than maintenance with a continuous infusion with PCEA.The mechanism for this difference is not known; however, one suggested mechanism is improved spread of the local anesthetic within the epidural space. Kaynar et al. injected methylene blue dye through a multi-orifice catheter using either a continuous infusion or intermittent bolus and the area of diffusion was measured on a piece of paper. The authors found that intermittent boluses were associated with a greater surface area of diffusion than continuous infusion. In a cadaver study, dye was injected into the lumbar epidural space, and cryomicrotome sections were taken.Dye flowed in rivulets through small channels in the epidural space, as opposed to moving as a unified front. The authors found dye injected at high pressures had more uniform spread through the epidural space, supporting the concept of intermittent epidural injection providing superior analgesia.~Epidural infusion pumps capable of delivering PIEB of local anesthetic with PCEA have become commercially available and many studies have attempted to assess the optimal parameter settings (including volume of programmed bolus, bolus interval, rate of bolus administration) to provide superior labor analgesia. Recently we completed a double-blinded randomized control trial evaluating two bolus delivery rates, hypothesizing that those patients randomized to receive higher bolus delivery rates would have improved labor analgesia. However, no difference was found between groups.What is more, both groups had a mean cephalad sensory level to cold of T6. This sensory level is higher than the traditional goal of T10 (upper dermatome level of uterine innervation), but despite the adequate sensory level, a large number of patients required supplemental physician-delivered boluses of local anesthetic during labor. Forty percent of the women in the high-rate group and 36% of the low-rate group required a manual re-dose during labor. This suggests that either a higher volume, or higher concentration of local anesthetic (i.e., higher dose) is needed to maintain adequate labor analgesia.~Traditionally higher concentration local anesthetic solutions have been associated with increased motor blockade leading to a higher incidence of instrumental vaginal delivery. Several local anesthetic solutions with varying drug concentrations are available for labor analgesia and are used clinically in the United States. We plan to perform a randomized, controlled, double-blind study to test the hypothesis that patients whose labor analgesia is maintained using PIEB with low-volume bolus (6.25 mL) of a higher local anesthetic concentration solution (0.1% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL) will require less supplemental analgesia (manual provider re-doses) than patients whose PIEB is delivered with a high-volume bolus (10 mL) of lower density local anesthetic solution (0.0625% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL).~The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between bolus volume and concentration of local anesthetic during maintenance of labor analgesia with programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB) analgesia.~The hypothesis of this study is: patients whose labor analgesia is maintained using PIEB with low-volume bolus (6.25 mL) of higher local anesthetic concentration solution (0.1% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL) will have a longer duration of adequate analgesia (time to first manual re-dose request) than patients whose PIEB is delivered with a high-volume bolus (10 mL) of lower concentration local anesthetic solution (0.0625% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL)._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  pain~anesthesia~labor pain_Inclusion Criteria:~18 years and above~Nulliparous parturients~Present to the labor and delivery unit for an induction of labor or who are in spontaneous labor~Request neuraxial labor analgesia at ≤5 cm cervical dilation~Exclusion Criteria:~Patients who are not eligible to receive a combined spinal epidural (CSE) technique with 25 mcg of intrathecal fentanyl~Non-English speaking~Failed initiation of CSE analgesia (VAS pain score >10 15 minutes after intrathecal dose)~Need to have the epidural catheter replaced during labor~Who deliver within 90 minutes of initiation of labor analgesia~Require re-dose within 90 minutes of initiation of labor analgesia."

Using new guidelines of optimal vitamin D levels, more than 90% of African American women now suffer from vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency during pregnancy has profound effects on the developing fetus. Other systems besides bones are affected by vitamin D deficiency, including an increased risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, and certain cancers.~This study proposes to examine and manage vitamin D levels in more than one thousand women in an underserved population in South Carolina. The women will be from the patient population seeking OB/GYN and Pediatric services through Eau Claire Cooperative Health Centers, Inc. (ECCHC), a network of ten clinics in three counties in the center of the state approximately 70 miles from Charleston, SC. ECCHC is one of approximately 1000 community health centers supported through Health and Human Services' (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA), Bureau of Primary Health Care.~The research objectives for this project will be managed through the Pediatric Nutritional Sciences Research Center of the Children's Research Institute at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, in collaboration with ECCHC. The research aims will evaluate vitamin D levels and possible contributing factors to the levels in pregnant women. Women who present to ECCHC within the first trimester of pregnancy will be randomized to one of two doses of vitamin D supplementation shown to be effective in other groups. Each pregnant mother will begin supplementation during the 12th week of pregnancy and will be followed closely throughout pregnancy for one year to determine the effectiveness of supplementation on vitamin D status, overall health of mother, and of her infant following delivery.~We expect to observe severe vitamin D deficiency in a considerable percentage of the mothers and their infants who receive care at ECCHC, especially those individuals with darker pigmentation. When the extent of vitamin D deficiency within each racial/ethnic group is better defined and their supplementation requirements identified, we will be better able to establish guidelines for supplementation and health maintenance, and set policy recommendations for the dietary recommended intake of vitamin D. Those women and their infants identified as deficient in vitamin D will be important in establishing community health care policies for vitamin D surveillance and supplementation strategies. The results will allow us to implement specific dietary and/or medical interventions aimed at correcting hypovitaminosis D in the population in this study and other similar populations being served by the more than 1000 community health centers nationally._Female_16 Years_45 Years_Conditions:  vitamin d deficiency~pregnancy_Inclusion Criteria:~Aim 1: Any mother who presents to her obstetrician or midwife at Eau Claire with confirmation of a singleton pregnancy will be eligible for enrollment in Aim 1.~Aim 2: If the mother also is <12 completed weeks of gestation, she will be eligible for participation of Aim 2 of the study.

"148","NCT01943565_Intrathecal Hydromorphone for Post-cesarean Delivery Pain - a Dose Finding Study_Pain relief after cesarean delivery can be provided in a few ways. Most commonly, certain medications called opioids, such as morphine, are given through the vein or into the muscle. However, a more effective way to give pain relief with fewer side effects (such as nausea and slowing your breathing) is to give opioids in the spinal space as part of the medications given for a cesarean delivery.~For many years, the opioid of choice was morphine due to its long anesthetic effect and acceptable side effect profile. A nation-wide disruption in the supply of preservative-free morphine has made it necessary to look for alternatives. Many institutions worldwide have used another opioid, called hydromorphone, in the spinal space for over a decade. This drug has a very good safety and side effect profile and has been used at the investigators' institution for more than a year. Of interest, while a number of different doses of hydromorphone have been used, there have been very few studies to evaluate the best dose for providing good pain relief with minimal side effects.

"154","NCT00669383_Rescue Antenatal Steroids and Lung Volumes in Preterm Infants_One course of steroids given to a mother before a premature delivery helps the lungs of the premature infant and decreases breathing problems. One course of antenatal steroids is the standard of care for threatened premature deliveries. It is unclear as to how long the benefit of one course of steroids last. The most benefit to the baby's lungs seem to occur if the steroids are given at least 24 hours before but within 7 days of a premature delivery. It is difficult to predict the timing of a preterm delivery so deliveries often do not occur within this time period. We hypothesize that the benefits of the steroids to the lungs wear off if the steroids are given more than 14 days before a preterm delivery, and that in these circumstances an extra course of steroids will help the premature baby's lungs and the premature baby will have less breathing problems as shown by lung function testing._Female_15 Years_N/A_Conditions:  respiratory compliance~functional residual capacity~pulmonary function testing_Inclusion Criteria:~Greater than 14 days after first course of antenatal steroids;~Less than 34 weeks of gestation;~Identified by primary physician as continued risk for preterm delivery;~Informed consent~Exclusion Criteria:~Major congenital anomalies~Multiple gestation of triplets or greater~Mother with insulin dependent diabetes"

"157","NCT02141555_Comparing Buccal and Vaginal Misoprostol in Management of Early Pregnancy Loss: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial_First trimester miscarriages are common. When the failed pregnancy does not pass spontaneously on its own, it is called a missed abortion. There are several ways in which missed abortions are managed, one of which involves administering a medication called misoprostol which causes uterine contractions inducing expulsion of the failed pregnancy. Misoprostol can be administered in multiple ways but has been traditionally inserted vaginally when used for management of missed abortions. Some studies have shown that some women are not comfortable with vaginal insertion of misoprostol and prefer oral administration. Buccal misoprostol is a way of administering misoprostol by having the patients insert the tablets of misoprostol between their gum and cheek, letting it dissolve for 30 minutes, then swallowing the remaining remnants. Buccal misoprostol is used safely in medical abortion. In fact a study by Fjerstad et al (2009), found a decrease in infection rate for medical abortion when misoprostol administration was switched from vaginal to buccal route combined with routine administration of doxycycline. The efficacy of using buccal misoprostol to treat missed abortions has not been studied previously to the investigators' knowledge. In this pilot study, investigators aim to test the hypotheses that buccal misoprostol is equally effective as vaginal misoprostol in the medical management of early pregnancy loss. As secondary outcomes, investigators suspect that buccal misoprostol may be associated with higher rates of gastrointestinal side effect but that patient satisfaction will remain equally as high for buccal misoprostol as for vaginal misoprostol._Female_18 Years_50 Years_Conditions:  spontaneous abortion in first trimester_Inclusion Criteria:~Women ages 18-50 who are English or Spanish speaking~First trimester pregnancy (less than 13 weeks and 0 days)~Desires medical management of an early pregnancy loss with misoprostol~Diagnosed with an early pregnancy failure by UCSD Radiology or diagnosed early pregnancy failure defined by any of the following criteria (Bourne 2013):~Crown-rump length > 7mm with no cardiac activity~Mean gestational sac diameter of > 25 mm and no embryo~Absence of an embryo with heartbeat > 2 weeks after a scan showing a gestational sac without a yolk sac~Absence of embryo with heartbeat > 11 days after a scan showing a gestational sac with a yolk sac~Exclusion Criteria:~Evidence of infection, acute hemorrhage, or hemodynamic instability~Hemoglobin less than 9.5 including use of point of care Hgb testing~Known allergy to misoprostol~Underwent surgical or medical abortion during current pregnancy~Currently breastfeeding~Currently has intrauterine device in place~Suspicion of ectopic or gestational trophoblastic disease~History of clotting disorder or on anticoagulant therapy (excluding aspirin)~Unreliable for follow up"

"195","NCT02922985_Multimodal Pain Management for Cesarean Delivery: A Randomized Control Trial_Opioid use and abuse has become a major medical problem in the United States. Over prescription of opioid medications is a major contributor to this growing problem. Cesarean delivery (CD) is the most commonly performed surgery in the US and women are generally given opioid medications for postoperative pain management. This is not a common practice in other developed countries. We believe that a multimodal pain management strategy is superior to current practices for control of postoperative pain after CD and will lead to a decrease in the use of opioid medications. This will have beneficial effects on patients' recovery and bonding with their newborns, as well as societal effects in reducing the burden of opioid abuse in the US. Our objective is to investigate the use of a multimodal pain regimen in pregnant patients undergoing CD. This is a randomized double-blinded, placebo controlled trial. The multimodal intervention consists of a pre-operative dose of IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev), infiltration of subcutaneous bupivacaine prior to skin incision, and a dose of IM ketorolac at time of fascial closure. These study medications are currently used in our patient population but not in a standardized fashion, not in every patient, and not always in combination with each other. The control group will receive placebo IV infusion preoperatively and an IM injection at fascial closure, and subcutaneous infiltration with normal saline before skin incision. Both groups will receive spinal regional anesthesia as per anesthesia team and then postoperatively, both groups will receive the current standard of care, which consists postoperative hydrocodone/acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed depending on pain score. Our primary outcome of interest will be the total opioid intake in the first 48 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes include time to first opioid given, pain scores at 6-12, 24 and 48 hours post op, and total number of opioid tablets left after discharge on post op day number 7. We will also evaluate patient satisfaction scores and total length of hospital stay. We will evaluate neonatal outcomes including Apgar scores, cord blood gases, immediate newborn complications in the first 48 hours after birth, and any infant adverse outcomes related to maternal opioid use up to 4 weeks of life. Our hypothesis is that our multimodal pain regimen will decrease the total opioid requirement in the first 48 hours after surgery._Female_18 Years_45 Years_Conditions:  pain_Inclusion Criteria:~Women who are 18 - 45 years of age at the time of cesarean delivery with the ability to give informed consent~Elective cesarean delivery~Gestational age ≥ 34 weeks~Fluent in either English or Spanish~Spinal anesthesia~Exclusion Criteria:~Urgent or emergent CD~Epidural or combined spinal epidural regional anesthesia~General anesthesia~Patients with a contraindication for regional anesthesia~Acute or chronic hepatic disease~Acute or chronic renal disease~Active asthma~Gastrointestinal ulceration~Inflammatory bowel disease~Allergy to ketorolac, acetaminophen, hydrocodone, codeine, ibuprofen or bupivacaine~Opioid dependence~Non reassuring fetal or maternal status requiring immediate delivery~Placenta previa or accreta~Acute or chronic pain disorder~Maternal weight <50 kilograms~Uncontrolled hypertension~Ischemic cardiac disease~Congestive heart failure~Thrombocytopenia, platelet count <150,000/microliter~Preeclampsia including Hemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelets syndrome~Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or active hemorrhage before randomization~Estimated blood loss > 2000 mL"

"203","NCT00224419_Testing Pharmacological Therapies for Pregnant Smokers_Nicotine dependence has not been sufficiently addressed in current state-of-the-science cessation interventions for pregnant smokers. The weight of the evidence from the general population of smokers suggests that nicotine replacement therapies may be beneficial cessation aids for pregnant smokers who are unable to stop smoking. The tremendous potential of these therapies for promoting smoking cessation among pregnant women creates a pressing need for decision tools and protocols to encourage treatment adherence that is essential for rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of OTC NRT when provided as part of prenatal care.

"222","NCT00275158_Effect of L-Arginine Therapy on the Glomerular Injury of Pre-Eclampsia: A Randomized Controlled Trial_Pre-eclampsia complicates 7 - 10% of pregnancies and constitutes a leading cause of fetal growth retardation and premature birth, as well as infant and maternal morbidity and mortality. The kidney is the primary site of injury resulting in high blood pressure, loss of protein into the urine and decreased kidney function. The release of vasoconstrictors over vasodilators from an abnormal placenta may underlie pre-eclampsia. Nitric Oxide (NO) is an important vasodilator that is thought to play an important role in the kidneys ability to accommodate to a healthy pregnancy. Normal pregnancy in the rat is accompanied by increased production of NO and its second messenger cGMP. There is a parallel increase in renal expression of constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme that generates NO from arginine. In the pregnant rat, an infusion of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an exogenous inhibitor of NOS, has been shown to replicate some of the hemodynamic features of the syndrome of pre-eclampsia. In a recent animal study, L-arginine supplementation reversed the adverse effects of L-NAME on pregnancy by attenuating the high blood pressure and by significantly decreasing protein loss in the urine. To date, studies of the use of L-arginine supplementation to treat women with pre-eclampsia have been small or uncontrolled and have only assessed blood pressure as a primary outcome measure.

"223","NCT04158713_Chemoprevention With Monthly IPTp With Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for Malaria in HIV-infected Pregnant Participants on Daily Cotrimoxazole in Kenya and Malawi: a Multi-centre Placebo-controlled Trial_2.3.3 Short technical protocol summary Background: Pregnant women represent a vulnerable population for malaria. HIV-infected women are particularly at risk. In HIV-infected pregnant women, WHO recommends daily cotrimoxazole (CTX), an antifolate drug, for malaria chemoprevention and prophylaxis against opportunistic infection. However, there is cross-resistance with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and high levels of antifolate resistance threatens the antimalarial effect of CTX. Recent trials with intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) with mefloquine in HIV-infected women on daily CTX, suggested that chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial markedly improves the protection against malaria compared to daily CTX alone. However, mefloquine was not well tolerated.~The long-acting combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is well tolerated and has shown great promise as IPTp in HIV-negative women in East-Africa. Chemoprevention with monthly DP has also been explored in HIV-infected pregnant women on daily CTX in Uganda. Unfortunately, the study was inconclusive because malaria transmission was too low and a clinically relevant drug interaction with efavirenz (EFV) was found reducing the exposure to DP. WHO now recommends dolutegravir (DTG) based combination antiretroviral therapy (ARTs) as the preferred firstline regimen including for pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. As a result, many countries in Africa are now transitioning to DTG-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cARTs). No such drug-drug interaction is expected between DTG and DP. We will, therefore, assess the safety and efficacy of malaria chemoprevention with monthly DP in HIV-infected women on daily CTX and DTG-based cARTs.~Objectives and methods: This is a 2-arm, individually-randomized, multi-centre, placebo-controlled superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of daily CTX plus monthly DP ('CTX-DP') versus daily CTX plus monthly placebo-DP (i.e. 'CTX-alone', control arm) to reduce malaria and the adverse effects of malaria in 898 (449 per arm) HIV-infected pregnant women on DTG-based cARTs. The study will be conducted in 8 hospitals in Kenya and Malawi in high SP-resistance areas with a high prevalence of malaria. These are the same sites where the sister trial in HIV-uninfected women is being conducted in Kenya and Malawi (IMPROVE trial). Both the mother and baby will be followed for 6-8 weeks after delivery. The study is powered at 80% (alpha=0.05) to detect ≥50% relative risk reduction (RR=0.50) in the primary outcome (cumulative incidence of malaria infection) from 12% in the CTX-alone arm (control arm) to 6% in in the interventions arm allowing for 20% non-contributors.

"234","NCT03967288_The Maternal CLIMB Trial: Chloroprocaine to Reduce the Impact of Motor Block on Patient Recovery After Short Obstetric Surgery_The following obstetric procedures are commonly performed with spinal anesthesia on labor and delivery: bilateral tubal ligation, external cephalic version, cerclage insertion, cerclage removal, minimally invasive fetal surgery, and evacuation of retained products of conception. Bupivacaine is currently the standard spinal medication for these procedures because of its long history of safe use, its low incidence of transient neurologic symptoms, and its ability to provide a dependable, dense block with a high degree of maternal satisfaction. While bupivacaine has the aforementioned advantages, it unfortunately has a long duration of action, up to 240-380 minutes, which far exceeds the time necessary to complete most obstetric procedures. Clorotekal®, the first Food and Drug Administration approved chloroprocaine solution created for spinal injection, is a potential alternative. When compared with bupivacaine spinals, chloroprocaine spinals have been shown to facilitate clinically significant shorter times to resolution of motor and sensory block, first ambulation, micturition, and discharge readiness. The objective of this study is to determine if a strategy of spinal anesthesia with chloroprocaine will reduce the duration of motor block, compared with equivalent block with hyperbaric bupivacaine.._Female_18 Years_60 Years_Conditions:  anesthesia, spinal_Inclusion Criteria:~Women 18 years old to 60 years old~American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class 1-3~Undergoing one of the following obstetric procedures: bilateral tubal ligation, external cephalic version, cerclage insertion, cerclage removal, minimally invasive fetal surgery, or evacuation of retained products of conception.~Exclusion Criteria:~Refusal of consent~Multiple gestations~History of ester local anesthetic or para-aminobenzoic acid allergy~Height less than 5 feet or greater than 6 feet~Body mass index less than 18.5 kg/m2 or greater than 45 kg/m2~Any coagulopathy defined by platelets < 80k/microliter, International Normalized Ratio > 1.2, or Partial Thromboplastin Time > 36 seconds~Signs of hypovolemia that is not corrected by routine management including hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) at the time of evaluation~Liver disease including jaundice and ascites, with elevated liver function tests, Aspartate Aminotransferase > 2x institutional normal, Alanine Aminotransferase > 2x institutional normal~Renal disease including history of dialysis, with elevated renal function tests on admission labs, glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2~Infection at the site of potential spinal insertion~Neurologic condition that contraindicates spinal anesthesia, tethered spinal cord or multiple sclerosis~Known atypical plasma cholinesterase activity~Other contraindications to receive a spinal anesthetic~Vulnerable populations including prisoners and decisionally impaired adults"

To meet objective 1, the investigators will collect quantitative data on participants' acceptability, health beliefs, barriers, and vaccination intentions using the health belief model (HBM) from patients meeting criteria for high-risk populations attending two public tertiary-level hospitals. To meet objective 2, in one of the two hospitals, the investigators will run an influenza vaccination campaign before the influenza season (the vaccines will be in the southern hemisphere), where the vaccine will be offered free of cost to high-risk patients, and in the second hospital, vaccination will not be offered. Both the vaccinated and unvaccinated participants will then be followed-up for one year period once a month to record any influenza-like illness, hospitalization, and death. Additional data for objective two on direct and indirect costs associated with influenza illness will be collected from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) at one public and one private hospital.

"245","NCT03438227_Intravenous Iron for Iron-deficiency Anemia in Pregnancy: a Randomized Controlled Trial_Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy worldwide, and, when severe, can have serious consequences for mothers and babies. While treatment of iron-deficiency anemia with iron supplementation is recommended, treatment strategies remain controversial: the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends oral iron supplementation with parental iron reserved for the rare patient who cannot tolerate or will not take oral iron, while UK professional organizations recommend a more liberal use of parenteral iron. The reason for these disparate recommendations is that few high-quality studies comparing oral to parenteral iron have been conducted in developed countries, and the potential impact of parental iron treatment on obstetric and perinatal outcomes remains unclear. We propose the first randomized-controlled trial in the United States describing the effectiveness and safety of treating pregnant women with iron-deficiency anemia with a protocol including parenteral iron compared with a protocol based on oral iron._Female_N/A_N/A_Conditions:  iron deficiency anemia of pregnancy~iron malabsorption_Inclusion Criteria:~Iron-deficiency anemia (serum ferritin <30 micrograms, normal hemoglobin electrophoresis, and hemoglobin <10 mg/dL), planned delivery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital~Exclusion Criteria:~Non-iron-deficiency anemia, multiple gestation, prenatally diagnosed major fetal anomalies, known aneuploidy, planned delivery at other hospital, inability to obtain consent"

"253","NCT02377466_Randomized, Double-blind, Multicenter, Phase III Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Retosiban Versus Placebo for Women in Spontaneous Preterm Labor_The study's primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of retosiban to prolong pregnancy and improve neonatal outcomes compared with placebo. It is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study and will be conducted in approximately 900 females, aged 12 to 45 years, with an uncomplicated, singleton pregnancy and intact membranes in preterm labor between 24^0/7 and 33^6/7 weeks of gestation. Eligible maternal subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either retosiban IV infusion or placebo IV infusion over 48 hours. If not previously administered, antenatal corticosteroid treatment should be administered as either (1) two 12-mg doses of betamethasone given intramuscularly 24 hours apart or (2) four 6-mg doses of betamethasone administered intramuscularly every 12 hours. A single rescue course of antenatal corticosteroids is permitted if the antecedent treatment was at least 7 days prior to study enrolment. Investigators have discretion to use a standardized regimen of magnesium sulphate, as well as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for perinatal group B streptococcal infection. Prior to randomization, each subject will be stratified by progesterone treatment and gestational age.

In situations where prenatal ultrasound records are not available at the time the subject presents, the investigator will make every effort to obtain these records (either via computer records, directly from the subject's primary care obstetrician, or via telephone). However, in cases in which these records are not readily available (e.g., off hours, holiday), it is within the investigator's discretion to use GA based on a verbal history from the subject with the intent of getting confirmation from the medical records as soon as possible.~Females must be diagnosed with preterm labor according to both of the following criteria: a) Regular uterine contractions at a rate of >=4 contractions of at least 30 seconds' duration during a 30-minute interval confirmed by tocodynamometry and at least 1 of the following, b) Cervical dilation >=2 centimeter (cm) and <=4 cm by digital cervical examination or c) If <2 cm dilation by digital cervical examination, a cervical change consisting of an increase of at least 25% effacement or 1-cm dilation.~Current or past tocolytic treatment as follows: a) Subjects in whom tocolytic treatment has not been initiated prior to consent are eligible for the study, b) Transferred or referred subjects for whom parenteral magnesium sulfate treatment has been started before Screening are eligible provided they meet all eligibility criteria, c) Subjects receiving a prohibited tocolytic in this study are eligible only if the treatment is stopped before randomization and provided they meet all eligibility criteria, d) Subjects with a historical failure of a tocolytic treatment in a previous episode of preterm labor during the current pregnancy are eligible provided they meet all eligibility criteria.~Exclusion Criteria:~Fever with a temperature >100.4 degree Fahrenheit (38 degree centigrade) for more than 1 hour or >=101 degree Fahrenheit (38.3 degree centigrade) in the 24 hours prior to the start of study treatment.~Women with maternal-fetal conditions that potentially necessitate the need for delivery, such as pre-eclampsia or fetal compromise.~A fetus with any diagnosis, condition, treatment, or other factor that in the opinion of the investigator has the potential to affect or confound assessments of efficacy or safety (for example: nonreassuring fetal status, intrauterine growth restriction, major congenital anomaly).~Preterm premature rupture of membranes.~Women with any confirmed or suspected contraindication to prolongation of pregnancy, such as placental abruption, chorioamnionitis, or placenta previa.~Evidence of polyhydramnios (AFI >25 cm) or oligohydramnios (AFI <5 cm).~Women with co-morbid medical or obstetric conditions that in the opinion of the investigator have the potential to complicate the pregnancy course and outcomes, such as uncontrolled hypertension or uncontrolled diabetes (if known, history of glycosylated hemoglobin >8% at any time during pregnancy), or compromise the safety of the subject, such as underlying cardiovascular disorder (specifically ischemic cardiac disease, congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy).~Women with a history of substance abuse during the pregnancy or urine drug screen positive for cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), methamphetamine, or amphetamine.~Women in whom the combination of history and screening test results is suggestive of abuse or dependency that may have the potential to complicate the pregnancy outcome.~Women with any diagnosis, condition, treatment, or other factor that, in the opinion of the investigator, has the potential to affect or confound assessments of efficacy or safety.~Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment).~History of sensitivity to any of the investigational products (IPs) or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GlaxoSmithKline/ Pharmaceutical Product Development (GSK/PPD) medical monitor, contraindicates the subject's participation."
"254","NCT01513447_Intracutaneous Sterile Water Injection as an Adjunct to Neuraxial Labor Analgesia: A Randomized Controlled Trial_For most women, the most significant pain they will experience is the pain associated with childbirth. Up to one-third of women experience back labor, this typically occurs when the fetus assumes varying degrees of malposition, especially the occiput posterior position, and causes additional constant pressure against the maternal spine and pelvis. Back labor presents as constant pain, that occurs even between contractions. It is often difficult to manage, by the patient, the obstetrician, and the anesthesiologist, and may increase the rate of instrumental and caesarian delivery.~Epidural anesthesia/analgesia is the most common and effective intervention used to help women cope with labor pain. Dilute concentrations of local anesthetic and opioid provide complete analgesia for most women. Some women, however, have breakthrough pain, often due to back labor, and require more concentrated drug solutions. This increases the side effects associated with these drugs (e.g., hypotension, pruritus, motor block), thus treatment of this pain poses a challenge for the anesthesiologist and the obstetrician.~Sterile water injections (SWI) are a simple and well-established method of managing labor pain among midwives. This intervention was first used to alleviate pain associated with kidney stones, and was introduced to obstetrics in the 1970s. Using a syringe, small amounts of sterile water is deposited subcutaneously near the sacral area. The sterile water causes osmotic and mechanical irritation resulting in a brief (15-30 second) and significant stinging sensation. The onset of pain relief follows almost immediately and may last for up to two hours. The procedure can be repeated a number of times.~Sterile water for pain management is most often administered using four intracutaneous injections: two sites lateral to the lumbosacral spine and two sites 2-3 cm below and 1-2 cm medial to the original two injection sites. 0.1 mL of sterile water is injected between the dermal layers to raise a small bleb on the skin surface at each of the four sites. In labor, the injections are administered sequentially during a uterine contraction, with the series of four injections, performed two at a time, completed within 20-30 seconds.~The investigators hypothesize that the use of sterile water injections in women with neuraxial analgesia with breakthrough pain will result in decreased local anesthetic requirements and increase patient satisfaction._Female_18 Years_60 Years_Conditions:  labor pain_Inclusion Criteria:~multiparous women~spontaneous labor~at least 18 years of age~presenting for vaginal delivery with cervical dilation of 4 centimeters or less~Exclusion Criteria:~nulliparous~less than 18 years old~contraindication to placement of neuraxial anesthetic~skin infection in area to be injected~medical therapies considered to result in tolerance to opioids~history of chronic pain (requiring regular medical follow-up with pain specialists)~recent use of opioid analgesics (within the year preceding pregnancy)"

"269","NCT01472549_Antiseptic Skin Preparation for Preventing Surgical Site Infection at Cesarean Delivery: a Randomized Comparative Effectiveness Trial_The investigators propose a randomized controlled clinical trial to determine the comparative effectiveness of chlorhexidine-alcohol and iodine-alcohol preoperative skin preparation for preventing surgical site infections at cesarean section. While estimates vary, surgical site infections complicate up to 5 - 10% of all cesarean sections and result in significant human suffering and excess health care costs. Interventions such as preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis reduce surgical site infections by 60%, but the rate of infection remains high. There is therefore a great need to identify and test other potential interventions to further reduce these infections.~The skin is a major source of pathogens that cause surgical site infection. Therefore, optimizing preoperative skin antisepsis has the potential to decrease postoperative surgical site infections. There is paucity of evidence to guide the choice of antiseptic for skin preparation at cesarean section. To date, only two underpowered trials have been published comparing two methods of preoperative skin preparation at cesarean section. A recent randomized trial in adults undergoing clean-contaminated mostly general surgical procedures demonstrated a 41% reduction in surgical site infection with the use of chlorhexidine-alcohol when compared to the more commonly used povidone-iodine. While it is plausible that findings from trials in other clean-contaminated surgical procedures may apply to cesarean sections, physiological changes in pregnancy, the peculiar dual microbial source for cesarean-related infections and the hormone-mediated immune-modulation in pregnancy make the validity of such extrapolation uncertain.~The study has the following specific aims:~Primary Aim: To test the hypothesis that preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation at cesarean section significantly reduces surgical site infections compared to iodine-alcohol.~Secondary Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation at cesarean section significantly reduces bacterial contamination at the surgical site compared to iodine-alcohol.~Secondary Aim 2: To determine clinical outcomes and medical costs associated with cesarean-related infections and quantify potential cost savings attributable to use of chlorhexidine-alcohol for preoperative skin preparation at cesarean section._Female_N/A_N/A_Conditions:  surgical site infections_Inclusion Criteria:~Women undergoing cesarean delivery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.~Exclusion Criteria:~Inability to obtain consent; allergy to chlorhexidine, alcohol, iodine, shellfish; and evidence of infection adjacent to operative site."
"270","NCT00118820_Antibiotic Efficacy in Third Molar Surgery_Despite over 50 years of antibiotic use and multiple clinical investigations (>50), no definitive studies exist to confirm or refute the use of systemic antibiotics to prevent postoperative inflammatory complications after third molar (M3), aka wisdom teeth removal. Among patients having M3s extracted, does the administration of systemic prophylactic antibiotics when compared to placebo, decrease the rate of postoperative inflammatory complications? The first specific aim of the study is to implement a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine if systemic prophylactic antibiotics, when compared to placebo, decrease the rate of postoperative alveolar osteitis (AO) after M3 extraction. For this proposal, postoperative AO is the primary outcome variable.~The second specific aim is to implement a pilot study using a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine if systemic prophylactic antibiotics, when compared to placebo, decrease the rate of postoperative infection after M3 extraction. For the purposes of this proposal, postoperative infection is a secondary outcome variable. Based on sample size estimates, we believe it will be necessary to implement a multi-year trial to address the second specific aim definitively. As such, we will use the experience and preliminary results derived from this clinical trial to develop and implement a future large scale clinical trial.~The third specific aim is to identify risk factors associated with postoperative inflammatory complications in order to develop a model to predict if the prophylactic administration of antibiotics will prevent the postoperative inflammatory complications of alveolar osteitis and infection following the removal of M3's.~The long-term goal of this project is to provide compelling clinical evidence to support recommendations regarding the use of systemic antibiotics in this setting and alter clinical practice based on the results of a well-done, definitive clinical investigation._All_13 Years_N/A_Conditions:  alveolar osteitis~dry socket~infection_Inclusion Criteria:~Demographics: While all ages are eligible for study enrollment, as a practical matter, most patients having M3s removed are usually > 13-14 years of age.~Gender: Males and females will be offered to participate in this study.~Race: All races and ethnicities are eligible for study enrollment.~Clinical status: at least one impacted mandibular third molar ( M3 ) must be scheduled for extraction.~Anesthesia: Patient request that the procedure be executed using intravenous sedation or general anesthesia.

"278","NCT03001661_A Randomised Controlled Trial of a Synthetic Osmotic Cervical Dilator for Induction of Labour in Comparison to Dinoprostone Vaginal insErt: the SOLVE Trial_Induction of labour (where labour is started artificially) is traditionally carried out with a range of different drugs or by surgery (rupturing the membranes or 'waters'). Dilapan-S is a mechanical device, known as an osmotic cervical dilator, which provides an alternative to drugs or surgery. Thin rods of an absorbent material (no active drug present) are inserted into the neck of the womb (cervix) and, as they absorb fluid, they swell and mimic the natural process of 'ripening' (or preparing) the cervix. This initial process is important before contractions begin. Unlike drugs, Dilapan-S does not cause premature contractions that, when too frequent, may cause the baby to become distressed. The project will compare cervical ripening using Dilapan-S with the standard use prostaglandin drug. Women with a single pregnancy, who require induction of labour, and who are not considered high risk, will be invited to participate. Investigators hope to recruit 860 women from UK maternity units over 2 years. Participants will have an equal chance of being randomised to the drug, which is standard practice, or the cervical dilator. The speed in which labour commences, the mode of delivery and any side effects will be compared. Importantly, investigators shall also assess patient satisfaction and anxiety during the induction process, by asking participants to complete a short questionnaire about their experience before they go home after having their baby.

"282","NCT03567707_Exposure to Vaginal Microbiome in C-section Infants at High-risk for Allergies - A Pilot Study_The purpose of this research study is to assess at how differences in the microbiome (naturally occurring bacteria) of a baby may protect, or put a baby at risk, for allergic problems. The microbiome refers to the thousands of bacteria and molds that live in and on our bodies. The microbiome plays an important role in our health. Differences in the microbiome can affect our immune system in ways that might make some people more likely to get allergies and asthma.~Early life events and exposures are very important for establishing the human microbiome. The newborn baby's microbiome changes very quickly during the first weeks and months of life. There is information that suggests C-section birth is associated with higher risk of certain diseases, including allergies and asthma. Some researchers think one reason for this is that passing through the mother's vaginal canal during birth exposes the baby to bacteria that promote healthy immune system development, something that C-section babies don't get. Transferring these potentially beneficial vaginal bacteria to C-section babies may help prevent some diseases later._Female_18 Years_45 Years_Conditions:  allergic diseases~asthma_Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant woman must be able to understand and provide informed consent;~Pregnant women with singleton pregnancies with a non-anomalous, appropriately-grown fetus; and~Atopic disease (asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis) or food allergy in a first-degree relative of the infant to-be-delivered (for exception, see exclusion criteria*).~Exclusion Criteria:~For C-Section Mothers:~In labor with evidence of cervical change prior to the scheduled C-section;~Rupture of the amniotic sac; or~Vaginal pH > 4.5 on the day of delivery.~For Vaginal Delivery Mothers:~- Use of induction agents for cervical ripening (cervical prostaglandin or Foley catheter).~For All Mothers and Their Infants:~Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent or comply with study protocol;~History of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis within the past year in the mother;~Express no intention to breastfeed;~History of diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes mellitus;~History of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (e.g., Crohn's Disease or ulcerative colitis);~Evidence of an active sexually transmitted infection (STI) (e.g., primary herpes or genital warts, or trichomonas), yeast infection, or vaginosis on the day of delivery;~Evidence of prior or current hepatitis B or C infection as demonstrated by the presence of the hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody positivity against the hepatitis B core antigen, or antibody positivity against the hepatitis C virus;~--Assessment for active hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection will be repeated for this study even if prior testing during the current pregnancy was negative;~Evidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (e.g., positive HIV serology or detectable viral load);~Positive Group B Streptococcus (GBS) test results by rectovaginal swab performed within 5 weeks of delivery, a prior infant with invasive GBS disease, or GBS bacteriuria at any point during pregnancy;~Evidence of N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection by testing performed within 5 weeks of delivery;~History of antibiotic administration during the third trimester of the current pregnancy;~Mothers with serious chronic conditions during pregnancy;~Mothers with complicated pregnancies including pre-eclampsia, chorioamnionitis, placenta previa, vasa previa, placental abruption, or active vaginal bleeding;~Maternal fever on the day of delivery (visit 0);~Infants with complications during delivery, such that the infant requires more than the standard neonatal resuscitation after delivery;~Infants delivered prior to 37 weeks of gestation;~Thick particulate meconium noted upon delivery of the infant;~Presence of a congenital abnormality in the infant for which study participation is not recommended;~Current, diagnosed mental illness or current, diagnosed or self-reported drug or alcohol abuse in the mother that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements;~Use of investigational drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy; or~Past or current medical problems or findings from physical examination or laboratory testing that are not listed above, which, in the opinion of the investigator may:~Pose additional risks from participation in the study,~Interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements, or~May impact the quality or interpretation of the data obtained from the study."
"283","NCT00135902_A Randomized Trial of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation to Prevent Preterm Birth in Pregnancies at High Risk_A recently completed trial of weekly injections of 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) found significant effectiveness for 17P in preventing recurrent preterm birth. However, the group who received 17P in this trial still had a high rate of preterm birth. Several reports have shown that dietary supplementation of fish oil, which is rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, reduces the risk of preterm birth. This trial tests whether adding the Omega-3 supplement to 17P therapy has the potential for further reducing the risk of preterm birth in women who have previously had a spontaneous preterm delivery. The trial will compare Omega-3 fatty acid with placebo in women receiving 17P therapy.

"289","NCT04542148_Glycemic Control After Antenatal Corticosteroids in Women With Pregestational and Gestational Diabetes (Close the GAP)_There is a fundamental gap in understanding the maternal and neonatal effects of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration in women with threatened preterm birth (PTB) who have diabetes. Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM, and there is limited data among women with gestational diabetes. While ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS in women with diabetes. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with diabetes as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims will determine the optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform a larger, multicenter trial to improve neonatal outcomes among women with diabetes and threatened PTB._All_N/A_50 Years_Conditions:  diabetes mellitus, type 2~preterm birth~pregnancy, high risk~diabetes, gestational_Inclusion Criteria:~Gestational or pregestational type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with daily insulin injection(s) or oral hypoglycemic agents such as metformin~Hospitalized for antenatal corticosteroid administration in anticipation of preterm birth~Gestational age 23 0/7 weeks - 36 5/7 weeks~Maternal age 18-50~Exclusion Criteria:~Planned delivery < 72 hours after 1st dose of antenatal corticosteroids~More than 16 hours after 1st dose of antenatal corticosteroids~Major fetal anomaly~Triplet or higher order multiple gestation"

Hyperemesis gravidarum is also surprisingly common. In fact, it is the second leading cause of preterm hospitalization during pregnancy, second only preterm labor. Hospitalization is often required because hyperemesis is frequently refractory to common anti-nausea medications. However, capsaicin cream, a potent TRPV1 agonist, commonly used to relieve muscular and neuropathic pain, may be able to reduce the symptoms of nausea and emesis in patients with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Smaller studies have demonstrated capsaicin to be both safe and effective when used to treat intraoperative nausea during cesarean delivery. To begin to address whether capsaicin cream could be used to reduce preterm admissions and shorten emergency room visits for hyperemesis, this study will randomize women presenting to the emergency room for nausea and vomiting to treatment with capsaicin cream as an adjunctive medication or routine care. The project will investigate the impact of capsaicin cream on hospital length of stay as well as representation for additional treatment. If effective, capsaicin cream has the potential not only to reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions and overall health care costs, but also to drastically improve patient quality of life._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  hyperemesis gravidarum~nausea gravidarum~vomiting of pregnancy_Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant women in the first trimester (0-14 weeks gestation)~Presenting to the emergency room at Women & Infants Hospital in Rhode Island with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting~English or Spanish speaking~Have not taken an anti-emetic such as Reglan or Zofran within the 6 hours prior to presentation~Exclusion Criteria:~Allergy to Reglan, capsaicin or Zofran~Another identifiable source for nausea and vomiting (i.e. gastritis, COVID, diabetic ketoacidosis)~Molar pregnancies,~Patients with a history of gastroparesis~Patients with a history of preexisting diabetes mellitus"

"306","NCT01916681_Foley OR MisO for the Management of Induction (FOR MOMI) Trial_The percentage of women undergoing an induction of labor (IOL) is estimated to be 20% and continues to rise. Simultaneously, the cesarean delivery (CD) rate has continued to increase (2). Induction is a known risk factor for CD. Despite numerous studies evaluating time periods to define a failed IOL, there are no guidelines or accepted definitions of when to call an IOL failed given the incremental gain in vaginal delivery when IOL is prolonged. While decreasing the CD rate is an important primary focus in obstetrics, attention must also be paid to the overall length of labor given that prolonged labor is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, a prolonged labor is associated with an increase in direct hospital costs and healthcare utilization. The use of cervical ripening agents, such as vaginal prostaglandin and mechanical dilators, has been demonstrated to reduce labor time and CD rate. In addition to specific individual agents, certain dosing and regimens for IOL and active labor have been compared to evaluate whether a particular dose or regimen can decrease the length of labor and decrease the CD rate. Most of these regimens; however, focus on individual induction agents and few have compared the efficacy of using more than one agent simultaneously. Given the associated risks of prolonged labor and limited data evaluating the use of combined cervical ripening agents, our objective is to evaluate the difference in time to delivery among women who undergo an IOL with four different methods._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  delivery; prolonged_Inclusion Criteria:~All women 18 years of age or greater~singleton gestation~vertex presentation~37 weeks gestational age or greater~undergoing an IOL~bishop score less than or equal to 6~cervical dilation less than or equal to 2cm~Exclusion Criteria:~All women less than 18 years of age~Contraindication for vaginal delivery~Prior cesarean delivery~Multiple gestation~Intrauterine fetal demise~Fetal anomaly~HIV~Unable to consent/ non-English speaking~Non-reassuring fetal heart rate~Patients with hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelets~Eclampsia~Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) 5th percentile with abnormal dopplers~IUGR less than 10th percentile with reversed end diastolic flow~Recurrent late decelerations w~Continuous contractions more than 3 times in 10 minutes at onset of IOL (given that this is a contraindication to misoprostol use at our institution)~Bishop score is greater than 6~Cervical dilation greater than or equal to 2cm~Confirmed ruptured membranes"

"322","NCT01636063_Mifepristone Versus Misoprostol for Cervical Preparation Prior to Surgical Abortion Between 11 to 15 Weeks_Surgical abortion in the late first trimester and early second trimester is usually performed with the aid of a cervical preparing agent, which helps to open up the uterine cervix for the procedure. Routine use of cervical preparants is recommended by several organizations during this period of pregnancy before surgical abortion, especially in younger women or those who have not delivered a baby, because their cervices may be more difficult to dilate without a preparant.~The standard medication used for cervical preparation is misoprostol. Unfortunately, misoprostol may cause uncomfortable uterine cramping and vaginal bleeding in patients who use it. Another medication called mifepristone has been shown to dilate the cervix better than misoprostol in the first trimester, but little information exists about using mifepristone in the late first trimester and early second trimester.~The investigators plan to perform a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate if mifepristone is a better cervical preparant than misoprostol. A total of 110 participants who are pregnant women desiring pregnancy termination 11 to 15 weeks gestational age will be recruited. Half will receive mifepristone and the other half misoprostol. The investigators will measure the amount of cervical dilation achieved right before a surgical abortion to determine if mifepristone is significantly different than misoprostol as a cervical preparant at this stage of pregnancy. The investigators expect that mifepristone will work better than misoprostol for this purpose.~The investigators hope to generate information about mifepristone so that women and their health care providers can know more about mifepristone as an option for cervical preparation before surgical abortion._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  induced abortion~abortion techniques~mifepristone~misoprostol_Inclusion Criteria:~Age greater or equal to 18 years~Fluency in English or Spanish~Intrauterine pregnancy between 11 0/7 and 15 0/7 on the day of the abortion procedure~Desire for pregnancy termination~Ability to return for abortion procedure 24-48 hours after the preoperative visit~Exclusion Criteria:~Allergy or contraindication to study agents~Requirement of general anesthesia to perform the abortion~Diagnosis of missed abortion, spontaneous abortion, incomplete abortion, or threatened abortion at time of initial preoperative evaluation"

"331","NCT02314728_Cervical Ripening in Premature Rupture of Membranes_Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is diagnosed by demonstrating amniotic fluid in the vaginal canal before the onset of labor. The integrity of the amniotic membrane is compromised thereby increasing the risk of intrauterine infection and compression of the umbilical cord. PROM complicates 3% to 8% of pregnancies in the US and is responsible for 30% of preterm births. Intrauterine infection remains the most significant maternal and neonatal sequelae associated with PROM and this risk increases with the length of time from ruptured membrane to delivery. Induction of labor has been shown to reduce the rates of chorioamnionitis, endometritis and NICU admissions4. Specifically, induction of labor with prostaglandin agents followed by oxytocin, versus oxytocin alone has been shown to be effective for labor induction resulting in vaginal delivery. Management strategies for PROM have been controversial, and published studies on outcomes are over one to two decades old, which does not account for changes in clinical trends and practice patterns. Recently ACOG recommends that patients presenting at 37 weeks gestation or greater with PROM should be induced if not in labor, and generally with oxytocin. In women with PROM without the onset of labor, the cervix is commonly unfavorable and induction with oxytocin alone may lead to an increased risk of cesarean section. With a c-section rate as high as 33%, women undergoing induction of labor have an increased risk of c-section and its associated morbidity and long term sequela. ACOG's recommendation for the use of oxytocin as the induction agent may be meant to avoid a theoretical increased risk of chorioamnionitis in this patient population however it does not take into account the status of the cervix, which may result in a increased risk of c-section. The purpose of the proposed study is to determine whether cervical ripening in women with PROM and an unfavorable cervix is associated with increase rates of vaginal delivery and decreased cesarean section rate compared to induction of labor with oxytocin alone. The investigators aim to determine the incidence of endometritis, and neonatal infection associated with PROM in the current medical environment of antibiotic prophylaxis and antenatal steroid use, taking into account the changes in patient characteristics._Female_15 Years_50 Years_Conditions:  pregnancy~premature rupture of membranes~preterm premature rupture of membranes~unfavorable cervix_Inclusion Criteria:~All pregnant women diagnosed with PROM without evidence of labor requiring induction~Gestational Age > 34 weeks~Bishop score < 6~Category I Fetal heart rate tracing~Exclusion Criteria:~Contraindication to Induction of Labor~Multiple gestation~Fetal Anomalies~Previous C-Section~HIV Positive Patients"

As a result, the administration of an IV fluid bolus (preload) is standard prior to epidural placement. However, the optimal volume of preload is unknown and no clinical trials have evaluated a risk-factor based approach to dosing. Studies in the critical care, trauma, and obstetric literature have suggested that a narrow pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures) is a marker of reduced intravascular volume status and may identify women at a higher risk for new onset fetal heart rate changes after epidural placement. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess if an increased IV fluid preload bolus among women with a narrow pulse pressure reduces the risk of new onset fetal heart rate changes after epidural placement._Female_18 Years_50 Years_Conditions:  fetus or neonate affected by maternal epidural anesthesia during labor and delivery_Inclusion Criteria:~Singleton pregnancy with gestational age ≥ 35 weeks~Admission for delivery~Age 18 or older~Desires neuraxial analgesia in labor~No exclusion criteria~Maternal pulse pressure < 45 mmHg on admission (verified by repeat blood pressure)~Category 1 FHT on admission/prior to epidural placement~Epidural placement within 6 hours of admission to Labor and Delivery~Exclusion Criteria:~Multiple gestation~Intrauterine growth restriction~Hypertensive disorders (gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension, and preeclampsia/eclampsia)~Gestational or pregestational diabetes mellitus~Substance abuse~Intrauterine fetal demise~Congenital or chromosomal fetal abnormalities~Category II or III FHR tracing on admission to L&D (pre-epidural)~Contraindication to neuraxial aesthesia (e.g. thrombocytopenia)~Maternal cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, active pulmonary edema or any other underlying maternal cardiopulmonary condition that increases the risk of pulmonary edema~Maternal renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.0)~Maternal hypotension (as defined in secondary outcomes below) prior to epidural placement"

Several studies have shown that obese women experience increased labor duration and oxytocin needs when compared to normal-weight women. This in turn results in increased rates for unplanned cesarean delivery (CD) as a result of failed induction of labor (IOL), arrest disorders and non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing, that is dose-dependent with increasing class of obesity.

"362","NCT02528981_Effect of Probiotics on GBS Colonization Status During Pregnancy: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial_Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in Canada. It may be passed from a study participant colonized in the genital tract by GBS to their baby during vaginal birth. While approximately 10 to 30% of pregnant people harbour GBS in the vagina or rectum, the incidence of neonatal GBS disease is 1 to 2 infants per 1000 births. The use of intrapartum antibiotics to treat colonized individuals with or without risk factors has led to a 70% decline in the incidence of early-onset GBS sepsis in the past decade. Despite this impressive decline, antibiotic resistance has become a major public health concern. Association between intrapartum antibiotic use and ampicillin resistance in E. coli isolated from neonates has previously been documented. Furthermore, while GBS has remained sensitive to penicillin, 20% are resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, which are alternate drugs for patients allergic to penicillin. Alternative approaches are therefore needed to reduce the risk of GBS infection.~We therefore propose to study the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 (Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14) in the colonization status of GBS in pregnant people. Lactobacilli are part of normal gut and vaginal flora and have been widely used as probiotics to treat various conditions. In particular, these two strains have shown to be beneficial in the treatment of urinary tract infections and bacterial vaginosis. Our study design involves recruiting two hundred pregnant people (one hundred in each arm) through various midwifery practices in the GTA at the end of their first trimester of pregnancy. These individuals will be randomized to receive probiotics or placebo for twelve weeks of their pregnancies and will be cultured before delivery to determine their colonization status. The capsules with probiotics and placebo will be provided free of charge.

"371","NCT00458003_Phenylephrine Versus Ephedrine to Treat Spinal Anesthesia-Induced Hypotension in Preeclamptic Patients During Cesarean Delivery_Hypotension remains a common clinical problem after induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Maternal hypotension has been associated with considerable morbidity (maternal nausea and vomiting and fetal/neonatal acidemia). Traditionally, ephedrine has been the vasopressor of choice because of concerns about phenylephrine's potential adverse effect on uterine blood flow. This practice was based on animal studies which showed that ephedrine maintained cardiac output and uterine blood flow, while direct acting vasoconstrictors, e.g., phenylephrine, decreased uteroplacental perfusion. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that phenylephrine has similar efficacy to ephedrine for preventing and treating hypotension and may be associated with a lower incidence of fetal acidosis. All of these studies have been performed in healthy patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery.~Preeclampsia complicates 5-6% of all pregnancies and is a significant contributor to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Many preeclamptic patients require cesarean delivery of the infant. These patients often have uteroplacental insufficiency. Given the potential for significant hypotension after spinal anesthesia and its effect on an already compromised fetus, prevention of (relative) hypotension in preeclamptic patients is important. Spinal anesthesia in preeclamptic patients has been shown to have no adverse neonatal outcomes as compared to epidural anesthesia when hypotension is treated adequately. Due to problems related to management of the difficult airway and coagulopathy, both of which are more common in preeclamptic women, spinal anesthesia may be the preferred regional anesthesia technique. Recent studies have demonstrated that preeclamptic patients may experience less hypotension after spinal anesthesia than their healthy counterparts. To our knowledge, phenylephrine for the treatment of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension has not been studied in women with preeclampsia. The aim of our study is to compare intravenous infusion regimens of phenylephrine versus ephedrine for the treatment of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension in preeclamptic patients undergoing cesarean delivery. The primary outcome variable is umbilical artery pH._Female_18 Years_60 Years_Conditions:  preeclampsia~hypotension_Inclusion Criteria:~ASA PS II - III women~18 years old and older~scheduled for cesarean delivery (no trial of labor)~eligible for spinal anesthesia~diagnosis of preeclampsia~Exclusion Criteria:~patients with failed trial of labor~preexisting hypertension~body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m2~resting heart rate < 60 bpm~progression to eclampsia, > twin gestation~known fetal anomalies~contraindications to spinal anesthesia~emergency procedure or refusal of consent~failure to achieve a T6 level of anesthesia~conversion to general anesthesia"

"379","NCT00830765_The Use of Progesterone to Reduce Preterm Birth_Preterm birth is the most common and costly complication in obstetrics. It complicates up to 11 % of all pregnancies and it is responsible for 70% of sick babies. Recently two studies have shown that giving progesterone (a normal hormone made by the ovaries) prolongs gestation in women who have had a preterm birth in an earlier pregnancy (and therefore are at risk for another early delivery). There are other studies that show that this technique of giving a weekly shot of progesterone does not prevent preterm birth. In addition, There are other groups of patients who are at very high risk for preterm birth which have not been studied. They include: 1.) Cervical cerclage (a stitch in the mouth of the womb); 2.) Multifetal gestation (twins, triplets, etc.); 3.) Women with preterm (<34 weeks) rupture of the membranes; 4.) Women with preterm labor during the current pregnancy with intact membranes who have been tocolyzed (have their labor stopped and are getting ready to go home). We purpose to give weekly shots of progesterone or a placebo in a randomized fashion to women in the first group who are at risk for preterm delivery due to an early birth in a previous pregnancy as well as the other four groups listed. If progesterone given weekly is successful at preventing early delivery as compared to the placebo group then great benefit for these women as well as future pregnancies would be accrued._Female_16 Years_45 Years_Conditions:  preterm birth_Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnancy 20 - 34 weeks; cervical dilation <4 cm; risk for preterm birth; multifetal gestation; diagnosis of preterm labor during the current pregnancy effectively tocolyzed); preterm rupture of the fetal membranes (24 - 34 weeks); willing and able to sign Informed Consent Form~Exclusion Criteria:~Failure to meet inclusion criteria as noted above; contraindication to pregnancy continuation; severe medical diseases such as sickle cell disease with crises, diabetes mellitus (F/R/H), severe preeclampsia etc., (physician judgment; severe fetal/obstetric criteria such as intrauterine growth restriction (<5th percentile, placental abruption,placental previa, etc., (physician judgment); non reassuring fetal assessment; allergy to progesterone compounds; refusal to participate"

"382","NCT02571439_A Randomized Controlled Trial of Surgical TAP-block After Cesarean Delivery: a Cost-effective Alternative to the Conventional TAP-block_The TAP is a space between the muscle layers of the abdominal wall that houses nerves supplying the abdominal skin. Injecting the local anesthetic ropivacaine into this space will block these nerves and prevent pain following c-section. The investigators will compare two different approaches to injecting the local anesthetic in this space. Conventionally, the block is done after surgery is completed and the abdomen is closed. The anesthesiologist introduces a needle through the abdominal wall skin under ultrasound guidance to reach the TAP space and the drug is injected. Since the TAP layer is one of the deeper layers of the abdominal (belly) wall and is closer to the inside of the abdomen than to the outside (skin), injecting from the inner aspect of the abdominal wall during the surgery is easier and quicker to perform than the conventional block and does not require ultrasound guidance as there is no risk of injury to abdominal organs like the liver.~With this research the investigators attempt to prove that surgically administered TAP blocks take 25% less time to perform compared to the conventionally administered TAP block for post cesarean section pain relief. Surgical TAP blocks are also more cost-effective as in addition to reduced OR time, they are safer and do not require skilled operator and specialized equipment.

Spinal anesthesia (single injection in the lower back to numb patients from the waist down) is commonly used in Cesarean section to provide numbness and pain relief during the surgery, and adding morphine to the spinal anesthetic provides long lasting pain relief for up to 24 hours after surgery. The ideal dose of spinal morphine, when given with other types of pain medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and acetaminophen, has not been determined. In addition, spinal morphine can have side effects such as nausea and itching, so using a lower dose of morphine may decrease these side effects while providing the same amount of postoperative pain relief. Study participants will be divided into two groups. Group 1 will receive the standard dose of spinal morphine (0.1mg) while Group 2 will receive a lower dose of spinal morphine (0.05mg).

"395","NCT00720291_Inflammation and Treatment of Bacterial Vaginosis Near Term_Most studies demonstrate that untreated bacterial vaginosis increases the rate of preterm birth. Despite this, there is no evidence that screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis nor interpregnancy treatment of endometritis decreases the subsequent rate of preterm birth. However, treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis has been associated with a modest reduction in subsequent preterm birth. Potential mechanisms for this reduction include a decrease in peripheral maternal pro-inflammatory activation of the TH1 inflammatory cascade with treatment, however this direct pathway has not been elucidated. The approved treatment for bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy consists of Metronidazole 500mg BID for 7 days. A more complete understanding of the effect of Metronidazole on maternal inflammation would be useful in designing strategies to reduce the rates of preterm birth.~This study proposes to determine the effect of standard treatment of BV carriage on maternal serum markers of inflammation. This will be accomplished by giving patients with asymptomatic BV either the standard treatment of metronidazole or a placebo for 7 days.

"402","NCT05973747_Pharmacokinetic Equivalence of Calcium Gluconate and Calcium Chloride in Parturients_Calcium is a life saving medicine in the care of parturients. It has many important uses including treatment of hypocalcemia, treatment of magnesium toxicity, prevention of hypocalcemia during blood transfusion (of citrate containing blood products), treatment of hyperkalemia, and others. Recent clinical trials also suggest that calcium given after cord clamping may decrease blood loss in patients undergoing cesarean delivery. 2 FDA approved forms of calcium can be given intravenously: calcium chloride and calcium gluconate. Over the last decade there have been times with drug shortages of either calcium chloride or calcium gluconate. So there have been and likely will continue to be times when one formulation or the other may not be adequately available. Despite the importance of calcium and the frequency in which it is used in parturients, there are no published studies in parturients to determine dose equivalence between calcium gluconate and calcium chloride. In this study the investigators will determine the population pharmacokinetics of calcium gluconate and calcium chloride in parturients and calculate the dose equivalent ratio the two drugs.

If a patient has been diagnosed with rupture of their water bag between 18 0/7 weeks and 22 6/7 weeks and there are no other associated complications with the pregnancy, the patient is eligible for initial consideration for this study. Patients will be admitted to the hospital for a 24-hour monitoring period. If the patient remains without further complications during this monitoring period, the patient will be eligible for enrollment. If enrollment is desired, the patient will be randomly assigned to receive either antibiotics (treatment arm of the study) or no antibiotics (control arm of the study). The treatment arm will receive an outpatient, 7-day course of oral antibiotics (azithromycin and amoxicillin) with the first dose given in the hospital to ensure no side effects. The control arm will not receive outpatient antibiotics. Both groups will have weekly, office follow-up visits with high-risk pregnancy specialists to ensure no further complications. Both groups will be admitted to the hospital if the patients reach 23 0/7 weeks without complications. At this time the patients will receive all medications and therapies recommended by the governing board of OBGYNs. Subjects of both groups will also be admitted before 23 0/7 weeks if further complications noted either at their clinic follow up visits or anytime outside of the hospital.

"406","NCT02216383_Intramuscular Oxytocics: A Randomised Control Trial of Intramuscular Carbetocin, Syntocinon and Syntometrine for the Third Stage of Labour Following Vaginal Birth_A quarter of all pregnancy and child-birth related deaths are due to excessive bleeding after the birth, post-partum haemorrhage (PPH). In the UK, PPH affects approx 10% of new mothers. PPH can be frightening for women and cause them to need additional treatments prolonging their hospital stay.~Commonly PPH is caused by an inadequately contracted womb after childbirth. Giving the mother an injection of uterotonic medicine following the birth of their baby can prevent this. It reduces the risk of PPH by 66%.~In the UK, the two medicines most commonly used are Syntocinon and Syntometrine. Syntometrine is longer acting, but a published review of trials concluded that Syntometrine is no better at preventing severe blood loss. Syntometrine is associated with more side effects including nausea, vomiting, and high blood pressure, and has been linked with rare, but fatal, cases of stroke. All guidelines therefore recommend Syntocinon for preventing PPH.Following a telephone survey of all maternity units in the UK, 71.4% of units still routinely use Syntometrine.~Carbetocin is a newer medicine, already widely used after caesarean section, but not yet after vaginal birth. Other studies have shown that Carbetocin is slightly better at preventing bleeding after birth when compared to Syntometrine, has fewer side effects than Syntometrine, and that it may be just as good as Syntocinon at preventing PPH. No studies have directly compared all three medicines or compared their overall cost; information vital to the NHS.~Investigators propose a trial of 5712 women over 13 months, in four maternity units to compare the effectiveness, side effects and cost of Syntocinon, Syntometrine and Carbetocin, for women having a vaginal birth.~Women will be randomly allocated to receive one of these drugs.

"411","NCT03098407_A Pilot Randomized Comparative Effectiveness Clinical Trial of Buprenorphine vs. Methadone for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence in Pregnancy._The incidence of opioid dependence in pregnancy increased over the last decade from 1.2 to 5.8 per 1,000 hospital births per year.1 While methadone is the current, standard treatment for opioid dependent (OD) pregnant women, buprenorphine recently emerged as an alternative. In a recent clinical trial (MOTHER), buprenorphine was associated with superior neonatal outcomes such as shorter duration of treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) compared to methadone. However, buprenorphine was also associated with greater study discontinuation (33% vs. 18%) and illicit opioid use (33% vs. 23%) compared to methadone. Treatment dropout often leads to relapse and resumption of high-risk behaviors, overshadowing any short-term improvement in neonatal outcomes. Therefore, The goal of this K23 proposal is to conduct a pilot study to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized comparative effectiveness clinical trial comparing office-based buprenorphine vs. federally licensed methadone programs for the treatment of OD pregnant women.~A pilot study is critical to develop the outcome measures, assessment tools and participant tracking techniques necessary for a future, large-scale comparative effectiveness clinical trial. An examination of feasibility and acceptability will also allow use to characterize the subpopulations of OD pregnant women willing to participate in treatment randomization, identify patient and provider characteristics associated with established treatment preferences and inform the development of strategies to improve participation and enhance the generalizability of the future large-scale clinical trial._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  opioid-related disorders~pregnancy_Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant women 18+ years old, with a singleton pregnancy ≤ 28 weeks gestation confirmed by ultrasound, who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria for opioid dependence confirmed by urine drug screen (UDS), who are interested in opioid maintenance treatment and plan to receive prenatal care and deliver at Magee Womens Hospital (MWH) will be recruited.~Exclusion Criteria:~(1) active, current dependence on benzodiazepines or alcohol~(2) acute severe psychiatric condition in need of immediate treatment (e.g. suicidal ideations)~(3) pending or legal action that could prohibit or interfere with participation (e.g. incarceration)~(4) current, established treatment with methadone or buprenorphine.

The procedure is performed under ultrasound guidance, after identification of the external oblique, internal oblique and transverse abdominis muscle. Medication is injected in the neurofascial plane between the internal oblique and the tranversus abdominis muscle.~Previous studies have demonstrated limited (<24 hour) effect of the block when compared to the use of intrathecal morphine (considered to be the gold standard for postoperative analgesia). In a study by McMarrow et al., post-caesarian pain control combinations including TAP blocks with local anesthetic (Bupivacaine) or saline after a spinal anesthetic with or without intrathecal morphine were compared.~At 6 hours the Morphine consumption was slightly reduced in the patients that received both intrathecal morphine and TAP blocks with LA when compared to patients that received spinal saline and TAP with saline. At 24 hours the TAP block conferred no benefit in terms of opioid consumption. Similarly, the study by Lee et al. demonstrated better pain scores for the first 2 hours in patients receiving both intrathecal morphine and a TAP block with ropivacaine. At 24 hours there was no difference in the pain scores for patients that received both intrathecal morphine and TAP blocks.~On the contrary, a more recent study utilizing liposomal bupivacaine has been utilized for TAP blocks for post cesarean delivery analgesia, demonstrating opioid reductions for up to 72 hours. Liposomal bupivacaine is a novel, multivesicular formulation designed for rapid absorption, prolonged release of bupivacaine, and analgesia following a single intra-operative administration into the surgical wound or for TAP blocks.~Current anesthesia practices encourage the use of multimodal analgesia that aim at enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). The ERAS model aims to decrease immobility, pain and post-operative ileus. Pain and immobility may be closely related, and the latter has rarely been monitored in the post-operative setting.

This objective is based on the hypothesis that prolonging the time to delivery in the absence of harm may benefit the newborn, particularly in women who experience spontaneous preterm labor at early gestational ages (GA). This study is designed to test this hypothesis through a direct comparison with atosiban, a mixed oxytocin vasopressin antagonist indicated for short-term use to delay imminent preterm birth in women between 24^0/7 and 33^6/7 weeks' gestation in preterm labor. This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study, which consists of 6 phases: Screening, Inpatient Randomized Treatment, Post Infusion Assessment, Delivery, Maternal Post Delivery Assessment, and Neonatal Medical Review.

"456","NCT04417595_Investigating N-3 Fatty Acids to Prevent Neonatal Tobacco-related outcomeS_Smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth, neonatal death, and maternal complications. Rates of smoking cessation during pregnancy are low, particularly in underserved populations, and currently approved pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation either are considered unsafe in pregnancy or have uncertain effectiveness. Identifying safe and effective interventions, which might mitigate the adverse effects of smoking on maternal-fetal outcomes, is a major public health priority. We hypothesize that smoking-induced n-3 LCPUFA relative deficiencies may be an important mechanism contributing to tobacco-related adverse pregnancy outcomes and that n-3 LCPUFA supplementation specifically targeted to pregnant smokers may reduce these complications. Support for this hypothesis comes from a recent secondary analysis of the Omega-3 Fatty Acids Supplementation to Prevent Preterm Birth trial that found that only smokers taking n-3 LCPUFAs had a reduction in preterm labor risk as compared to non-smokers. While compelling, this study was a post hoc analysis that included only a small sample of smokers and did not collect data on smoking behaviors during follow up. Yet the ascertainment of longitudinal smoking behavior is critical, as some clinical studies have found that supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs might also reduce nicotine cravings, and lower daily cigarette use. Thus, smokers may doubly benefit from replenishing n-3 LCPUFAs via lower risk of preterm labor and/or increased smoking cessation. To address these knowledge gaps, we are proposing a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in 400 pregnant smokers. We will collect detailed information on smoking behavior, validated biological markers of cigarette exposure (urinary cotinine, end-expiratory carbon monoxide) and biomarkers of n-3 LCPUFA status (red blood cell phospholipid membrane fatty acids). Our specific aims of this proposal are to 1) determine the effect of supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs on gestational age at delivery and preterm labor in pregnant smokers and 2) determine the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on tobacco use in pregnant smokers. We will recruit potential participants from eight obstetrics clinics across the Middle-Tennessee area. Our study could have a major translational impact on both adverse tobacco-related birth outcomes and smoking cessation efforts._Female_16 Years_40 Years_Conditions:  preterm labor~tobacco use disorder_Inclusion Criteria:~≥ 16 or ≤ 40 years of age~Currently reporting daily cigarette use (≥ 1 CPD; reporting 10 or more CPD prior to pregnancy)~Between 12 and 24 weeks gestation~An exhaled carbon monoxide reading of at least 8 ppm~A cell phone or land line that can be reached directly~Exclusion Criteria:~Allergy to fish; currently using fish oil supplements~Active substance abuse (not including supervised buprenorphine use)~Unable to give consent or obtain assent for minors~Known fetal abnormality~Chronic hypertension~Seizure disorder~Clotting disorder~White's classification D or higher diabetes~Planned cerclage~Plan move from the Middle-Tennessee area within the next 9-months~Insufficient time to perform the complete enrollment process~Barrier to communication (e.g., low English proficiency or hearing/speech impairment)"

"474","NCT00671060_Misoprostol for Treatment of Fetal Death at 14-28 Weeks of Pregnancy, Inclusive, Not Accompanied by Complete Expulsion of the Contents of the Uterus_The purpose of the proposed study is to test - in a randomized, blinded trial - two different doses of the prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol administered buccally as a treatment for fetal death at 14 - 28 weeks, inclusive, of pregnancy. At such an advanced stage of pregnancy, the nonviable fetus is often not spontaneously evacuated, and yet timely evacuation is vital in order to avoid the possibility of, among other things, potentially life-threatening maternal coagulopathies. Current approaches to uterine evacuation in these cases include dilatation and evacuation (D&E) surgery (in less advanced pregnancies) and labor induction with a variety of products. Misoprostol has been demonstrated to be as effective as, or more effective than, either oxytocin or prostaglandin E2 analogues for this indication in a number of small, non-FDA-approved trials which have been published in the peer-reviewed literature. In the absence of more formal study of this treatment, however, dosages are not standardized, pathways of administration vary, and other uncertainties linger. The purpose of the protocol proposed herein is to formally establish, via a randomized, double-blinded study, the safety and effectiveness of misoprostol for this indication, and to compare the value of two distinct doses, so that providers may henceforward proceed with greater authority and confidence._Female_N/A_N/A_Conditions:  intrauterine fetal demise_Inclusion Criteria:~Women presents with spontaneous fetal death~Gestational age of fetus between 14-28 weeks~Exclusion Criteria:~Transmural uterine scar;~Allergies or other contraindications to use of misoprostol;~Placental abruption with active hemorrhage;~Complete placenta previa;~Extreme uterine structural anomalies;~Or other contraindications to vaginal delivery of the fetus;~Presentation in active labor (moderate to severe contractions every 10 minutes); or~Four or more previous deliveries"

"478","NCT02188459_Placebo-controlled Trial of Bupropion for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Women_Smoking during pregnancy adversely affects the health of the mother and her developing baby. Maternal smoking approximately doubles the risk of miscarriage, placental complications, preterm delivery, low birth weight and fetal and newborn death. The most common adverse effect of smoking during pregnancy is low birth weight, which sharply increases the risk of the newborn becoming ill or dying. In the US, maternal smoking is responsible for 30% of low birth weight babies, 10% of premature deliveries, and 5% of infant deaths. Fortunately, smoking cessation by pregnancy week 16, or as late as the third trimester, results in a near-normal weight infant at birth. Even reductions in smoking increase birth weight.~Despite the known risks, the majority of women who are smoking at the time of their first prenatal visit continue to smoke. Bupropion is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for smoking cessation in people who are not pregnant, but there are no carefully controlled studies on the use of Bupropion to help pregnant women quit smoking. Bupropion is also FDA approved to treat depression, and some pregnant women have taken it for that purpose, even though it has not been formally tested. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, parallel-group, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 10 week trial of Bupropion in 360 pregnant women who smoke daily and wish to quit smoking.~The study has three primary hypotheses. First, the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will decrease the frequency of smoking more than placebo-treated subjects. Second the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have greater positive pregnancy and child health outcomes than placebo-treated subjects. Third the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have decreased frequency of depressive symptoms and cigarette craving than placebo-treated subjects. These finding will provide information on the safety and efficacy of bupropion treat for smoking cessation in pregnant women._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  smoking~nicotine dependence_Inclusion Criteria:~Currently smoking on average 3 or more cigarettes per day for the preceding 7 days with a breath CO of at least 5 ppm and wants to quit smoking~Pregnant at 13-26 weeks gestation (to maximize safety and the likelihood of receiving 10 weeks of treatment)~>18 years of age~Able to speak and read English at a 6th grade level or higher, using the Slosson Oral Reading Test (SORT)~Committed to remaining in the geographic area for at least 3 months postpartum~Able to sign written informed consent and commit to completing the procedures involved in the study.~Methadone or buprenorphine-maintained women must be in methadone or buprenorphine treatment for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to entering the study.

Uterine atony is estimated to cause 70-80% of postpartum hemorrhage. Prolonged labor and augmented labor are known risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage. In attempts to reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, particularly in patients with known risks factors, it is essential to optimize preventative practices in order to reduce the rates postpartum hemorrhage.~Although oxytocin is considered the first line therapy for preventing and treating uterine atony, early consideration of additional prophylactic uterotonic agents may be indicated in women with prior oxytocin exposure given oxytocin receptor desensitization and down regulation.~As such, investigators sought to examine whether multimodal prophylactic uterotonics (standard oxytocin + methylergonovine), in patients who are increased risk of developing postpartum hemorrhage (specifically laboring patients who ultimately require a cesarean section) would benefit from the addition of prophylactic uterotonics. The clinical rational for administration of multimodal prophylactic uterotonics at the time of cesarean delivery in laboring patients is three-fold: to decrease the incidence of uterine atony, to decrease the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, decrease the number of uterotonics required at the time of cesarean section.~The primary outcome will be to evaluate the need for additional uterotonic agents (Methylergonovine, Carboprost, Misoprostol) at the time of delivery.~Secondary outcomes will include the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (quantitative blood loss >1 liter), surgical assessment of uterine tone four minutes following delivery of the placenta, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, the need for a blood transfusion, intensive care unit admission, uterine infection (endometritis)._Female_18 Years_50 Years_Conditions:  uterine atony with hemorrhage_Inclusion Criteria:~18 years of age~Laboring patients who undergo a cesarean section~Exclusion Criteria:~Placenta/Uterine Abnormalities~Chronic Hypertension, Gestational Hypertension, Preeclampsia~HIV/AIDS on protease inhibitors~History of Coronary Artery Disease~History of Hypersensitivity to Methylergonovine"

"494","NCT01846221_Comparison of Fentanyl-bupivacaine and Clonidine-bupivacaine for Breakthrough Pain in Advanced Labor in Patients With Continuous Epidural Analgesia_Epidural analgesia has proven to be an effective method for severe pain relief associated with labor and delivery. During labor, a low dose continuous infusion of local anesthetic and narcotic will be administered through an epidural catheter. As labor progresses and the baby's head makes it way through the pelvis, breakthrough pain may emerge and often needs further treatment. The investigators provide pain relief by administering analgesics through the epidural catheter. The patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two medication mixtures believed to be successful in treating this type of pain associated with advanced labor. After this initial treatment, if pain relief is not attained, the patient may receive the other medication as well. The medications used in this study have been used at this institution for some time and have been found to be safe for mother and baby. The opioid (fentanyl) dose is small and only a small fraction will be transmitted to the baby. The other medication (clonidine) better known as a blood pressure medication has also been used for pain relief. Studies and clinical experience have shown that clonidine when given epidurally in the doses used in this study has minimal, if any effect, on the blood pressure of the mother or of the baby. The investigators will record medical and obstetric history and labor progress relevant to the patient. The patient will be asked questions regarding labor pain and side effects before and after the analgesic is administered. The primary objective is to determine which treatment regimen is more successful in abolishing breakthrough pain in advanced labor._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  labor pain_Inclusion Criteria:~women in labor at term pregnancy~healthy~epidural analgesia in place~breakthrough pain in advanced labor~Exclusion Criteria:~chronic pain syndrome~receiving systemic opioids within 4 hours~receiving chronic antidepressants, clonidine, opioids"

"501","NCT02096003_Comparison of Intrathecal Hydromorphone and Intrathecal Morphine for Postoperative Analgesia After Cesarean Delivery_The use of intrathecal opioids for analgesia in the setting of cesarean section has become standard obstetric anesthesia practice. Currently, two opioids are commonly used. These opioids are fentanyl and morphine (Duramorph). Intrathecal opioids are an excellent source of analgesia and act to reduce the stress response to surgery.~Currently, most obstetric anesthesiologists use intrathecal morphine for analgesia after cesarean delivery. Morphine provides excellent analgesia for cesarean section. However, use of this medication is associated with side effects such as pruritus and nausea and vomiting.~Recently, multiple obstetric anesthesia groups began to use intrathecal hydromorphone for cesarean delivery when morphine was unavailable. As groups began to use hydromorphone, retrospective data became available that demonstrated its safety and efficacy for use during cesarean section.~In order to fully elucidate the analgesic and side effect properties of hydromorphone for cesarean delivery, a prospective randomized, double blind study comparing morphine and hydromorphone is necessary. The investigators need to understand whether hydromorphone is as effective as morphine for analgesia after cesarean section, and whether it is associated with fewer or more side effects.

This can be a painful experience and health care providers often give women different kinds of pain medicine to help them.~The investigators are interested in whether a medicine called gabapentin, which is a non-narcotic medicine, could help. Gabapentin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of seizures and for treating nerve pain and doctors are also using it to decrease pain for people having surgical procedures.~The main goals of our study are to learn about:~Women's pain experience with dilators in their cervix overnight before the abortion procedure~How well gabapentin works to decrease women's pain while they have the dilators in their cervix~Women who enroll in the study will get a dose of either gabapentin or placebo (a pill with no medicine in it) before their dilators are placed in the clinic. The medication they get (gabapentin or placebo) will be chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the women in the study nor the doctors giving them the medication will know which medication they receive so the investigators can learn about their pain without being influenced by knowing which medication they take. Doctors will be able to find out which medication women got if there is an emergency or if it changes their medical care.~The investigators will communicate with women in real time overnight by text messaging to see how much pain they are having in the moment and how much pain medicine they are taking.~The investigators hypothesize that women who receive gabapentin will have a smaller increase in their pain with the dilators than women who receive placebo (a pill with no medicine in it).~The investigators' findings will help doctors understand women's pain experience with dilators better and possibly provide a new way of treating pain with gabapentin._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  abortion, induced~cervical preparation~pain_Inclusion Criteria:~15 weeks 0 days gestational age - 23 weeks 5 days gestational age at time of dilator insertion~Able to read and write in English~Active cell phone with text messaging capability~Ride home from dilator insertion clinic appointment~Exclusion Criteria:~Current use of gabapentin or pregabalin~Allergy to gabapentin, acetaminophen, codeine, or ibuprofen~Self reported renal disease (severe impaired renal function)~Self reported current or chronic narcotic use (typical daily use)~Women with any issue that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with study participation or generating accurate study data"

There remains a critical unmet need for developing a safe and effective non-pharmacological approach for attenuating metabolic inflammation and ameliorating the adverse effects of MO on offspring health that originate in utero and extend into the lactational period. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a diet-derived natural food supplement with anti-inflammatory properties that, in humans and mice, improves metabolism and exerts potent immunoregulatory effects. Researchers' central hypothesis is that PQQ administration during MO pregnancy 1) improves maternal metabolic and inflammatory indices, 2) improves utero-placental blood flow and ameliorates placental maladaptation (oxidative stress, hypoxia, inflammation and fatty acid transporter expression) and 3) reduces neonatal adiposity._Female_18 Years_40 Years_Conditions:  maternal obesity_Inclusion Criteria:~Adult women~Body mass index >30 kg/m2~Currently pregnant with gestational age up to 16 wks~Exclusion Criteria:~Women with pregestational diabetes (type 1 or type 2)~Smokers~Women with other risk factors for placental insufficiency or preterm delivery~Advanced maternal age (age ≥40 yrs)~Pre-existing chronic hypertension~Renal disease~Thrombophilias~Substance use~Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)~Hepatitis C~Autoimmune disorders"

A known side effect of combined spinal and epidural anesthesia (a type of labor analgesia) is an increased incidence of category II fetal heart rate tracing (defined below) and low blood pressure. The study team aims to study if a prophylactic dose of ephedrine will decrease the occurrence of this type of tracing after combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia placement. Ephedrine is not currently routinely used as prevention for category II tracings or low blood pressure. The use of Ephedrine in this study is investigational (this is the first time that the drug has been studied for its effect on these conditions).~Fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings are classified into three categories. In clinical practice, FHR tracing categories are used as a guide to obstetric management and suggest the following approach:~Category I tracing is reactive and reassuring → may continue labor~Category II tracing is neither category I nor category III. For obvious reasons, category II is the broadest and largest category, consisting of various FHR tracing patterns that do not fit into either category I or category III.~Category III tracing is non-reassuring → expedited vaginal or cesarean delivery recommended.~A Category II tracing is not diagnostic. Most pregnancies have at least one Category II tracing. There is not always an identifiable reason for a Category II tracing.~Ephedrine is a medication that causes an increase in heart rate and blood pressure while also causing some degree of relaxation of the uterus therefore improving uterine blood flow. It has been used in the obstetric population for over 50 years without issues.

"540","NCT03106753_Success of External Cephalic Version With Immediate Spinal Anesthesia Versus Spinal Anesthesia When Attempt Without Anesthesia Has Failed: A Randomized Controlled Trial_The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to optimize the success of external cephalic version (turning the baby from the outside). Attempting to turn babies in-utero is recommended because it may decrease the risk of needing a cesarean section for abnormal presentation. While the study team knows that this procedure can be effective, the study team still has some un-answered questions as to the best way to perform this procedure to increase the chance of success. Many prior studies have shown that using spinal anesthesia (a shot of medication placed in your back to numb and relax the abdomen) can increase the success rate of a version. This ultimately has led to the finding that using this anesthesia can decrease the rate of cesarean section. However, there have been only a small number of studies assessing the success rate if spinal anesthesia is used only in the event that without it fails. Therefore the study team is going to compare patients who receive spinal anesthesia with those who only receive spinal anesthesia if the procedure to turn the baby (ECV) fails without it._Female_18 Years_60 Years_Conditions:  external cephalic version_Inclusion Criteria:~Patients included are those with singleton pregnancies of at least 37 weeks gestation in nonvertex presentation with no contraindication for a vaginal delivery.~Membranes must be intact with a minimum of a 2x2 pocket and Category 1 non-stress test.~Exclusion Criteria:~All patients with a contraindication for a vaginal delivery will be excluded from the study.~Patients with gross fetal anomalies or uterine malformations.~Patients with contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia or allergies to any of the study medications will also be excluded."

"542","NCT00711971_Does EPA or DHA Prevent Depressive Symptoms in Pregnancy and Postpartum?_This study is designed to test whether an alternative medicine treatment, fish oil, will prevent depressive symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women who have been found to be at risk for depression. Epidemiologists have observed that people who live in countries where people on average eat a diet high in fish have a lower risk of depression than people who live in populations that eat less fish. Postpartum depression is also less common in these countries. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are thought to be responsible for this beneficial effect of eating fish. The two major omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is an essential building block of the brain and nerve tissue. EPA may act to optimize the electrical signals between nerve cells and brain cells and may help the immune system to function well.~Some researchers have treated people who are already suffering from depression with fish oil. Some of these studies have shown a benefit for the fish oil treatment and others have not. These studies have tested EPA and DHA alone and in various combinations. Currently, it is not known whether EPA or DHA is more effective in preventing and treating depression. Some of the researchers involved in this study have learned how to identify mothers who are most at risk for developing depression during and after pregnancy. This study is designed to learn whether EPA-rich and DHA-rich fish oil supplements will prevent depressive symptoms in women who are at risk to develop depression._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  depression_Inclusion Criteria:~Women who are more than 12 weeks pregnant but less than 20 weeks pregnant~Women who are found to be at risk for depression~Women who have been treated for depression in the past~Women with depression after a previous pregnancy~Women planning to deliver at University of Michigan Hospital~Exclusion Criteria:~Women who have major depression or other psychiatric disorders (current substance abuse, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) at the time of screening~Women who are currently taking anti-depressant or other psychiatric medications~Women who routinely eat more than 2 fish meals per week~Women on anticoagulants (blood thinners)~Women currently taking omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplements (fish oil, flaxseed oil or cod liver oil)~Women with bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand's disease~Women under the age of 18~Women with a multiple gestation (twins, for example)~Women planning to deliver at another hospital~Women planning to move away before 6 weeks after delivery"
"543","NCT01465191_Effect of OPRM1 Genotype on the Dose Response to Spinal Morphine for Post-Cesarean Analgesia_HYPOTHESIS: The response to a given dose of morphine given via a spinal anesthetic for cesarean section will be affected by the genetics of the woman's mu-opioid receptor~Most women undergoing elective cesarean section (CS) receive spinal anesthesia, and most receive a dose of preservative free morphine with the spinal anesthetic. Spinally-administered morphine provides 16-24 hours of high quality pain relief. The dose administered is usually 75-200 micrograms, but surprisingly few dose-response studies exist.~The mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1 gene)is the site of action of endogenous opioid peptides and opioid analgesic drugs like morphine. There is a common genetic variant of this receptor at the 40th amino acid of the protein, with asparagine and asparate being present in different people. The less common variant (aspartate), present in 25-30% of the overall American population (higher in Asian populations, lower in Blacks) at codon 40 that has been shown in many studies to affect opioid analgesia.~This will be a randomized, blinded study of 3 doses of spinal morphine (50, 100, 150 micrograms) given to women undergoing elective cesarean section at term pregnancy. 300 women will be studied (100 per dose). Blood will be obtained for genotyping of OPRM1 and other genes that may affect pain and analgesic responses. The primary outcome will be the amount of intravenous morphine patients self-administer in the 24 hours postsurgery.~The primary outcome (use of intravenous morphine) will be analyzed by dose, and within each dose group by genotype of OPRM1. Secondary outcomes will include pain scores every 6 hours, satisfaction with analgesia, side effects (itching, nausea/vomiting) by dose and genotype.~It is anticipated that there will be an interim data analysis at 150 evaluable subjects for assessment of the dose response to morphine in the overall population; then a final analysis at 300 subjects for the genetic effect assessment._Female_18 Years_45 Years_Conditions:  postoperative pain_Inclusion Criteria:~healthy women undergoing elective cesarean~Exclusion Criteria:~cardiovascular disease~analgesic medications~complications of pregnancy"

"551","NCT01621230_A Randomized Double-blinded Trial of the Effects of Bupivacaine Induced Motor Blockade on the Second Stage of Labor_The aim of this study is to measure the effects of bupivacaine administered via epidural catheters on indices of motor blockade ascertained during the second stage of labor. This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to address the primary research question: Does bupivacaine lengthen the second stage of labor? The secondary research question is: Is there other evidence of motor blockade attributable to bupivacaine during the second stage of labor?~The investigators know from prior studies that the length of the second stage in nulliparous women delivered at Parkland Hospital without epidural analgesia is 28 minutes. The investigators hypothesize in this now proposed study that epidural analgesia with bupivacaine will significantly increase this baseline from 28 minutes to 37 minutes or more (a 33% increase) thus implicating motor blockade. Baseline data for the Bromage and Breen scores during the second stage as well as the uterine contractility data are not available as these indices of motor blockade have not here-to-fore been studied in this context.~Currently at Parkland Hospital, 82% of nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor at term receive continuous epidural infusions with bupivacaine during the first and second stages of labor. Such women will be identified when admitted for scheduled inductions at Parkland. After informed consent is obtained standard management of labor induction will be provided. Those consented women reaching 8 cm cervical dilation will be randomized. Group I will receive bupivacaine plus fentanyl via epidural catheter during the second stage (i.e. 10 cm dilation) and Group II will receive only fentanyl infusion via epidural catheter (see study procedure below).

"552","NCT01376778_A Randomized Trial to Prevent Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV)_Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that usually presents with few if any side effects. When first infected, some people may have symptoms similar to mononucleosis (i.e., fatigue, weakness, fever, swollen glands). Most people in the United States are infected during childhood or as adults if they work around children. Pregnant women, who have not been infected with CMV in the past and become infected during pregnancy (i.e. a primary infection), may cause their babies to get infected with CMV. Babies that are infected may develop permanent disabilities including hearing loss and a small portion will die from the infection.~Currently it is not routine practice to screen pregnant women for CMV infection. Additionally, there is no agreement about how to evaluate and manage pregnant women infected with CMV for the first time. There is also no evidence that treatment is beneficial for the baby.~The purpose of this research study is to determine whether treating pregnant women who have a primary CMV infection with CMV antibodies will reduce the number of babies infected with CMV._Female_N/A_N/A_Conditions:  congenital cytomegalovirus infection~maternal cytomegalovirus infection_Inclusion Criteria:~Diagnosis of primary maternal CMV infection on the basis of one of the following:~A positive CMV Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody and low-avidity maternal CMV Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody screen~Evidence of maternal seroconversion with development of CMV IgG antibody following a prior negative CMV screen~Gestational age at randomization no later than 23 weeks 6 days based on clinical information and evaluation of the earliest ultrasound; or no later than 27 weeks 6 days for women with a positive IgM, negative IgG initially screened before 23 weeks who are rescreened after 2-4 weeks and have evidence of IgG seroconversion.~Singleton pregnancy.

This is known as a pregnancy of unknown location. These patients most likely have a pregnancy in the uterus that is too early to be seen on ultrasound, but it is possible that the pregnancy is not seen inside the uterus because it is outside of the uterus, known as an ectopic pregnancy. Patients with ectopic pregnancies are at risk for serious complications, and the medications used for medication abortion may not end an ectopic pregnancy.~Currently, at Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts (PPLM), patients seeking medication abortion, including some patients with a pregnancy of unknown location, are given mifepristone to begin the medication abortion at the clinic and then one dose of misoprostol to take at home to cause the pregnancy to pass. However, research suggests that a second dose of misoprostol leads to a higher rate of completed abortion for certain patients.~This research is being conducted to learn if two doses of the at-home misoprostol during the medication abortion process leads to a higher rate of completed abortion for patients with pregnancy of unknown location.

"585","NCT04612920_Towards Enhanced Recovery After Cesarean: Scheduled Post-operative Medication: a Randomized Controlled Trial_One in 300 women will become persistent opioid users after cesarean delivery (1). Cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure in the United States, representing 31.9% of the 3,788,235 deliveries in 2018 (2). Patients have to cope with the pain and challenges of post-operative care while adjusting to motherhood and completing activities of daily living. Often when they return home, they are also tasked with other domestic roles which compounds the challenge of this post-operative period. With a potential impact just in the US on 1.2 million mothers each year, optimizing post-operative pain management in order to reduce the risk of persistent opioid use represents an urgent unmet public health goal. To this end, there are national efforts to reduce the cesarean rate and optimize post-cesarean pain management (3,4). The majority of efforts in the last few years have focused on home-going medications and alterations in prescription practices. Recent recommendations from the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society indicate that patients should receive multi-modal analgesia on a regular basis, along with early post-delivery mobilization (3). However, the efficacy of scheduled non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAID) along with acetaminophen in the immediate post-operative period and after going home have not been systematically studied in the cesarean population. We hypothesize that patients who receive scheduled medications in the post-operative period are less likely to require opioids for pain relief both in the hospital and after they return home._Female_18 Years_50 Years_Conditions:  cesarean section complications_Inclusion Criteria:~Undergoing repeat cesarean delivery~≥37 week gestation~attended at least 7 prenatal visits~age ≥18.~Exclusion Criteria:~Non-English speaking, attended < 7 prenatal visits, fetal anomalies or death, inability to ambulate, BMI ≥45kg/m2 at delivery due to higher risk of regional analgesia complications, placental implantation abnormalities, maternal diabetes due to the risk of wound complications, chorioamnionitis, allergy to study medications, underlying renal or hepatic impairment, opioid use in the last 3 months, chronic controlled substance use, chronic pain disorders, history of narcotic addiction, intraoperative hemorrhage not controlled with medication alone, additional concurrent surgeries other than sterilization procedures and presence of endometriosis noted at time of surgery.

Up to 80% of PPH is caused by uterine atony, the failure of the uterine smooth muscle to contract and compress the uterine vasculature after delivery. Laboratory and epidemiological studies show that low extracellular and serum calcium levels, respectively, decrease uterine contractility. A pilot study performed by the investigators supports the hypothesis that intravenous calcium chloride is well tolerated and may have utility in preventing uterine atony. The proposed research will establish the relationship between uterine tone and calcium through a clinical trial with an incorporated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, investigators will establish the effect of 1 gram of intravenous calcium chloride upon quantitative blood loss and uterine tone during cesarean delivery in parturients with high risk of uterine atony. Investigators will concurrently collect serial venous blood samples to measure calcium for PK/PD modeling in this pregnant study cohort.

The drug was administered intravenously at the time of umbilical cord clamping for a non-emergent cesarean section. A maximum of 1 gram was administered. TXA serum levels at several time points after delivery were assayed to see if they reach the target plasma concentration of 10 microg/mL. A PK model was constructed for determining the optimal TXA dose administered at parturition.~In part 2 of the study, the investigators aim to compare PKPD endpoints using prophylactic TXA via IV and IM routes administered pre-cord clamp. The investigators will administer 1000 mg TXA within 10 minutes of skin incision via intravenous infusion (up to n=15), intravenous bolus < 2 minutes (up to n=15) and intramuscular injection (up to n=15). The investigators will target women undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery greater than 34 weeks gestation, women undergoing vaginal delivery > 34 weeks of gestation and morbidly obese women (BMI>50) undergoing either a vaginal or cesarean delivery.

Cabergoline is a medication approved for the symptomatic treatment of pituitary adenomas that result in a hyperprolactinemic state (a brain tumor that results in milk leakage). The benefit of stopping milk leakage has also been studied and used in populations who shouldn't breastfeed. The investigators aim to clarify if cabergoline is effective in preventing breast engorgement and milk leakage after second-trimester abortions or perinatal loss (stillbirth). Breast engorgement causes physical pain and emotional distress as lactation is uniquely associated with parenthood and those undergoing second-trimester abortions are doing so because they choose not to parent or a previously desired pregnancy is now complicated by anomalies. As there are no current recommendations for management of this painful engorgement beyond icepacks and support bras, the investigators aim to validate the use of this pharmacologic option in this setting._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  lactation suppressed_Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant people, ages 18 years or older~Intrauterine pregnancy between 18/0-28/0 weeks of gestation age (by ultrasound dating performed prior to or same day of enrollment visit)~Consented for an induced, elective abortion or undergoing induction for demise~English or Spanish speaking~Able to consent for a research study, literate in English or Spanish~Willing to comply with study procedures and follow-up~Access to smart phone throughout study~Exclusion Criteria:~Prior mastectomy (breast reduction or chest masculinization surgery acceptable)~Currently breastfeeding~Currently receiving dopamine agonist therapy for other indication (prolactinoma, Cushings syndrome, acromegaly, restless leg syndrome)~Contraindication to cabergoline (as per package insert)~Uncontrolled hypertension - defined as baseline BP > 150/100, or chronic hypertension requiring more than one baseline medication, or pregnancy-induced hypertension spectrum disorders (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia)~History of cardiac valvular disorders or valvular repair~History of pulmonary, pericardial, or retroperitoneal fibrotic disorders"

Treatment has been suggested in pregnant patients when systolic BP is ≥ 160 mmHg and at a lower diastolic BP threshold of 105 mm Hg, however some providers may initiate therapy at systolic BPs ≥ 150 mmHg.~Nifedipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator and an ideal first line antihypertensive agent due to its low maternal side-effect profile. It has been proven to be safe in pregnancy. Conventional nifedipine can be started at 10 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 120 mg/d, but frequently extended release tablets are preferred due to steady blood pressure control with once daily administration.~It is frequently used however as a twice daily dosing as many providers have noticed an increase in the BPs 12-24h from administration.

However, spinal opioids are associated with a wide variety of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, (N/V) and pruritus (itching). The occurrence of pruritus can vary between 30% and 100% making pruritus the most common side-effect of intrathecal opioids and this rate is even higher in pregnant patients. Pruritus may require treatment which can be ineffective or sometimes reverse the analgesic effect of the opioids. Ondansetron is a safe and very commonly used Serotonin receptor antagonist treatment for local anesthetic opioid-induced pruritus used in pregnancy.

"654","NCT02473276_Two Dose Neuraxial Morphine for Prevention of Postdural Puncture Headache_Neuraxial analgesia (most commonly continuous epidural or combined spinal epidural) is the most effective modality available for pain relief during labor. Accidental dural puncture (ADP) with a large bore epidural needle and the resulting post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is one of the most significant sources of anesthesia-related morbidity in parturients.~Epidural blood patch (EBP) is the gold standard for treatment of PDPH, and although almost always effective, can result in another ADP, as well as low back pain and lower extremity pain. For this reason, effective measures to prevent PDPH when ADP occurs would be highly valuable. One small study in which 50 women were randomly allocated to receive 2 epidural injections of morphine or saline, demonstrated a beneficial effect of epidural morphine in decreasing the incidence of PDPH.~This study aims to determine the efficacy of 2 doses of neuraxial (either epidural (EPID) or intrathecal) preservative-free morphine (PFM) to prevent headache after ADP in parturients._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  postdural puncture headache_Inclusion Criteria:~Subjects will be ASA I and II women aged 18 years and older, who are known to have had accidental dural puncture with an epidural needle during placement of neuraxial labor analgesia, and have either an intrathecal catheter or epidural catheter in place.~Exclusion Criteria:~Past history of headache syndromes- such as migraine and cluster headaches~History of chronic pain syndromes~Chronic opioid use~Illicit drug use - e.g. marijuana, heroin~Allergy to morphine~Intrapartum or postpartum fever ≥ 38 ° C~Coagulopathy~Accidental removal of the epidural or intrathecal catheter"

"661","NCT01074190_The Effect of Neuraxial Analgesia on Maternal Breastfeeding_A previous randomized trial showed a possible negative association with labor neuraxial analgesia with high compared to low doses of fentanyl, and breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum. The significance of this study would be to validate or refute these findings. In addition, we hope to better evaluate the impact of cumulative dose of fentanyl on breastfeeding success in the initial postpartum period as well as at 6 weeks and 6 months post delivery. In order to better assess the quality of breastfeeding, we will utilize a validated breastfeeding assessment tool, LATCH (Latch, Audible swallowing, Type of Nipple, Comfort, and Help). This validated tool can assess maternal and infant variables, define areas of needed intervention, and determine priorities in providing patient teaching. The LATCH assessment has been shown to be a predictor of breastfeeding duration. We also plan to vary the dosage of fentanyl analgesia to determine the relationship between doses below 150 micrograms and changes in breastfeeding assessments. If a clear association between decreased breastfeeding and total fentanyl is identified, then regimens to reduce cumulative doses of fentanyl can be developed to improve the likelihood of breastfeeding success in mothers that desire to breastfeed.~Prior observational studies have inferred epidurals negatively affect breastfeeding by decreasing maternal plasma oxytocin release which may adversely affect infant neurobehavioral development. In a study by Beilin et al., it was reported that mothers receiving a high cumulative dose (> 150 microgram) epidural fentanyl were more likely to have stopped nursing 6 weeks postpartum compared with groups receiving no fentanyl or those receiving < 150 microgram. The study however, was underpowered to detect differences in breastfeeding prior to hospital discharge. In addition, the breastfeeding assessment tool utilized resulted in binary assessments, and therefore, a global rating of the quality of breastfeeding was not available._Female_18 Years_N/A_Conditions:  pain~breastfeeding_Inclusion Criteria:~Age 18 and above~English speaking~Term gestation (> 38 weeks)~Parous parturients presenting for attempted vaginal delivery with a cervical dilation less than 8 cm~They must request neuraxial labor analgesia~Have previously successfully breastfed their child postpartum for at least 6 weeks~Are expressing an interest in exclusively breastfeeding postpartum~Exclusion Criteria:~Under 18 years of age~Parturients who have received parental opioids during labor or have taken opioids prenatally~Patients whose neuraxial analgesia failed due to abnormal spinal anatomy including scoliosis or previous spinal instrumentation~Supplemental epidural opioids during labor~Had an expedited labor with the delivery of the fetus less than 90 minutes from the placement of the neuraxial anesthestic~Underwent cesarean delivery~Received general analgesia for an unanticipated postpartum procedure~Dropout criteria include patients who wished to be taken out of the study or were lost to follow-up"

The current standard of care for PPROM subjects between the gestational age of 24 weeks and 0 days and 33 weeks and 6 days, is to administer ampicillin and erythromycin for a total of 7 days. Erythromycin can cause GI upset and some subjects do not tolerate this regimen over the course of 7 days. In addition, there is a national shortage of erythromycin, and published expert opinion proposed to use a second-generation macrolide (azithromycin) instead of erythromycin. Azithromycin can be taken once daily, is cheaper than erythromycin and has less GI upset adverse effects.

"671","NCT00486902_Does a Single Intravenous Dose of Ketamine Reduce the Need for Supplemental Opioids in Post-Cesarean Section Patients?_Pain control after cesarean delivery is associated with improved breastfeeding and infant rooming-in times. In addition, inadequate analgesia leads to elevated plasma catecholamine concentrations, which negatively affect every organ system. There is growing evidence that ketamine, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, is efficacious when used as an adjuvant in postoperative pain control. A 2006 Cochrane Collaboration systemic review and meta-analysis concluded, Ketamine in subanesthetic doses….is effective in reducing morphine requirements in the first 24 hours after surgery.~Ketamine's prolonged analgesic effect, despite its short half-life and its use in low doses, is theorized to be due to blockade of spinal cord central sensitization. Central sensitization is a phenomenon whereby repeated painful stimulus leads to more severe pain perception over time despite no change in the intensity of the painful stimulus.Ketamine may also prevent the development of acute opioid tolerance. Ketamine's analgesic effects have also demonstrated in the obstetric population. Post-cesarean delivery morphine requirements in women who received ketamine as part of a general anesthesia technique were decreased. Similary, low-dose ketamine in conjunction with bupivacaine-only spinal anesthesia reduced postoperative analgesic requirements compared to bupivacaine-only spinal anesthesia and bupivacaine-fentanyl spinal anesthesia.~In the United States, healthy women scheduled for elective cesarean delivery commonly receive spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine-fentanyl-morphine. To our knowledge, IV ketamine has not been studied as an adjuvant to this regimen in the analgesic management in post-cesarean delivery patients. Multimodal therapy for postoperative pain control is widely practiced due to the advantage it provides in blocking multiple pain pathways while minimizing side effects of each individual pain medication. We hypothesize that low dose intravenous ketamine will improve multi-modal post-cesarean analgesia compared to placebo. The purpose of this study is to evaluate this hypothesis and study the possible side effects of this regimen in combination with bupivacaine-fentanyl-morphine spinal anesthesia._Female_18 Years_60 Years_Conditions:  ketamine adverse reaction~effects of; anesthesia, spinal and epidural, in pregnancy~complication of labor and/or delivery_Inclusion Criteria:~Eligible women are at term (≥37 week gestation),~Healthy,~ASA class 1-2,~Scheduled for elective cesarean section whose anesthetic plan is for spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine and intravenous ketorolac analgesia for post operative analgesia~Exclusion Criteria:~Women with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status >2,~Body mass index ≥40 kg/m2,~Known allergy to any of the study medications,~Contraindication to the spinal anesthesia,~History of substance abuse,~History of hallucinations,~Chronic opioid therapy,~Chronic pain."
