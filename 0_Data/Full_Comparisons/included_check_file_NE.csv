Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with Sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP), the administration of SP at predefined intervals in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy irrespective of the presence of malaria parasitemia, is currently recommended for HIV-negative women in all areas with stable moderate to high transmission of malaria. Due to increasing resistance to SP, it is no longer used as a treatment for symptomatic malaria, and the efficacy of IPTp-SP seems to be decreased. This study aims to look at a new drug, Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) for IPTp, as well as to explore the strategy of intermittent screening and treatment in pregnancy (ISTp) with DP.

5,NCT03029702,Metabolic Analysis for Treatment Choice in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus,"Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a significant clinical and public health burden, affecting over 400,000 pregnant women in the United States each year. Without adequate treatment, women with GDM and their infants are at risk for substantial morbidity. Because of this, experts recommend treatment focused on normalization of hyperglycemia to improve outcomes. However, providers have limited capacity to predict which treatment will achieve glycemic goals. This results in a choice based on provider and patient preference and a trial and error approach, which can create delays in glycemic control within the short (8-10 weeks) window between diagnosis and delivery. Maternal and fetal morbidity may be related to a mismatch between glycemic pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of glucose-lowering agents. In fact, GDM is heterogeneous, with predominant insulin resistance (IR) in 50%, insulin secretion deficit (ISD) in 30%, and a combination of both in 20% of women as underlying mechanisms of hyperglycemia. This variation in GDM pathophysiology and clinical outcomes supports the use of an individualized treatment approach. The overall goal of this project is to investigate an individualized treatment approach for GDM where treatment is based on each woman's GDM mechanism. The study will employ the same treatment in both arms, but choice of treatment will differ based on study arm (matched or unmatched to GDM mechanism).",Female,18 Years,45 Years,"Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant women beyond 24 weeks of gestation who are scheduled for a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test.~Exclusion Criteria:~Fetal anomaly~Pregestational diabetes~GDM diagnosis without a 3-hour OGTT~Multifetal gestation~Treatment with non-inhaled steroids within 7 days~Allergy to glyburide, metformin or sulfa~History of severe pulmonary (pulmonary requirement for oxygen therapy or daily treatment for restrictive of obstructive pulmonary disease)~Hepatic (LFT's greater than two times of upper normal range)~Renal (serum creatinine higher than 1.2 mg/dL) disease~History of heart failure or myocardial infarction",Included,The study explicitly includes pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) beyond 24 weeks of gestation.

In this randomized double-blind trial, we aim to evaluate the effects of different combinations of PIEB (epidural bolus volume) and PIEB (bolus volume and time interval) on labour patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) usage. In theory, the more effective the PIEB combination (the ideal drug volume and ideal time interval), the less PCEA boluses (extra epidural drug) will be used as well as less clinician boluses and less lower limb weakness (motor block) as assessed by the Bromage Score.",Female,18 Years,50 Years,Inclusion Criteria:~Age 18 to 50 yrs~In active labour~ASA 2 patients (pregnant patients are considered to be ASA 2)~Singleton pregnancy~> 37 weeks gestation~Booking BMI 18 to 35~Exclusion Criteria:~BMI < 18~BMI > 35~Systemic opioids within the previous 6 hours~Presence of a fetal anomaly~Pre-eclampsia~Bleeding disorders (including coagulation disorders)~Recent spinal surgery~Spinal injury~Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)~Neuraxial disorders of any description~Signs of local or systemic infection~Patient refusal for neuraxial analgesia,Included,The trial explicitly includes pregnant individuals as it is focused on labor analgesia for those in active labor.,Inclusion Criteria:~Age 18 to 50 yrs~In active labour~ASA 2 patients (pregnant patients are considered to be ASA 2)~Singleton pregnancy~> 37 weeks gestation,1,0,0,"16.

19,NCT01192035,PI or NNRTI as First-line Treatment of HIV in a West African Population With Low Adherence - the PIONA Trial,"BACKGROUND: Since 1996 the combination of three or more drugs has been the mainstay of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. The most important types of drugs are called nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) Response to treatment is measured as increasing CD4+ cell count and decreasing HIV viral load. A major problem is the development of resistance. NNRTIs are recommended as part of first-line treatment of HIV in Africa but many Africans have a slower NNRTI clearance than Caucasians making them more susceptible for development of resistance in case of treatment interruptions. PIs might therefore be a better option in an African setting with low adherence.~AIM: To evaluate two different treatment regimens in HIV-1 infected patients:~A) A NNRTI (efavirenz/nevirapine) based regimen and B) A PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir) based regimen with regard to treatment outcomes. HYPOTHESIS: Treatment with a PI will be superior to treatment with a NNRTI due to less development of resistance.~METHODS: Treatment-naÃ¯ve adult HIV-1 patients enrolled in an existing cohort The West African Retrovirus and Acquired Immune Deficiency (WARAID) cohort in Guinea Bissau with CD4+ cell count â‰¤ 350 cells/ÂµL and/or clinical signs of immune suppression (World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage 3 or 4) will be randomised 1:1 to: Treatment A: 2 NRTIs (lamivudine and either zidovudine or stavudine) and 1 NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine) or Treatment B: 2 NRTIs (same as in treatment A) and 1 PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir). Primary outcome: Viral load suppression <400 copies/ml 12 months after enrolment.~PERSPECTIVES: Guidelines for treatment of HIV in Africa are more or less a copy of the guidelines used in Europe and North America. Genetic differences in pharmacokinetics, more women infected in Africa and difficulties ensuring good adherence mean that results obtained from Caucasian patients are not directly transferrable to African patients. The results of this study will hopefully help guiding the treatment of HIV in Africa in the future.

Research has examined the pharmacokinetics of different administration routes and effects on uterine contractility, side effects, and safety. Vaginal misoprostol has been shown to be superior over oral administration however patients often prefer a more tolerable route. Buccal administration has already been shown to be as effective as vaginal misoprostol for cervical ripening and induction in both first trimester and second trimester abortions.

35,NCT01810354,PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS PRIOR TO CESAREAN SECTION IN OBESE WOMEN: Does Increasing the Dose Increase the Tissue Concentration?,"Surgical site infections are common and a cause of major morbidity. They are also more common in obese women. Cesarean sections are the most common surgery performed in the United States, therefore pregnant women are being faced with this problem frequently. There is evidence to show that prophylactically administered antibiotics, cefazolin specifically, to obese women prior to cesarean section do not reach adequate concentrations in adipose tissue to prevent infection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if an increased dose of cefazolin will attain adequate tissue concentration in obese women. Our hypothesis is that three grams of cefazolin given no more than 60 minutes prior to the start of a cesarean section in an obese (Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30) woman will attain adequate adipose tissue concentration compared to two grams of cefazolin.~Subjects will be selected if they are greater than 37 weeks gestation wiht a singleton pregnancy and require a cesarean section for any obstetrical indication. Women will be excluded if they have a suspected infection, have a multiple gestation, or have preexisting diabetes or hypertension with end organ damage. The subjects will be screened both by through the OR schedule as well as through the clinics. They will then be consented and enrolled by the primary investigator. Once enrolled the subjects will be randomized to receive either two grams or three grams of cefazolin as prophylactic antibiotics to be given no more than 60 minutes prior to the start of the surgery.~Two adipose tissue samples will be obtained at the time of surgery. The first at the start after skin incision and the second at the end prior to closure of the skin. There will also be a separate IV placed at the start of the procedure from which three blood draws can be collected. These three samples will be obtained at the start of the surgery but after antibiotic administration, at the time of the first adipose collection, and at the time of the second adipose collection. The samples will then be stored at -80 degrees and shipped to David P. Nicolau's lab in Hartford, CT for the tissue and serum analysis.~While the subjects are in the hospital recovering from their surgery, a chart review will be performed to determine if there are any infections occuring post-operatively.

Moreover, obesity, irrespective of pregnancy, has been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for the development of postoperative surgical site infections. Development of such infections can have both consequential long-term medical sequelae for patients and economic impacts on the health care system at large. Cefazolin, a first generation hydrophilic cephalosporin whose clearance is exclusively mediated via the kidneys unchanged, is used as pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis for cesarean deliveries. The current accepted standard of care is to administer 2 grams of cefazolin within 60 minutes of skin incision. Studies of drug concentrations of cephalosporins for pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis in obese bariatric patients have shown that therapeutic concentrations may not be achieved in both tissue and plasma. Limited data exist in pregnancy. Therefore, it is the goal of this study to investigate whether obese patients presenting for cesarean delivery require an increased dosing amount of pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. This study will randomized women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or more who are presenting for their scheduled cesarean delivery to receive either 2 grams or 3 grams of cefazolin for pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis.

It complicates up to 11% of all pregnancies and it is responsible for 70% of sick babies. The ideal way to stop preterm labor when it occurs (which drug to use) is not known. Currently magnesium sulfate is used by about 95% of all practitioners, but recent data suggest magnesium given this way may be harmful for the baby's future development. Other drugs such as antiprostaglandin agents are very effective in stopping uterine activity, but particularly when used for >48 hours have been associated with both maternal and fetal sides effects. Lastly, calcium channel antagonists are effective in stopping contractions and have very little in the way of maternal and fetal side effects, but less data is available in the United States on their use. Because there is no FDA approved drug to stop preterm labor, we purpose to randomize all women with preterm labor (20-34 weeks) to receive one of the above three methods of stopping preterm labor.

Aspirin (ASA) is currently the only prophylactic therapy for preeclampsia in high-risk women to be recognized by the US Preventive Task Force and should be initiated early in the second trimester of pregnancy, before 16 weeks of gestation. However, currently there is no literature comparing various low-dose ASA formulations in the risk reduction of PE. In the United States, the currently available low-dose ASA is over the counter and is found in 81mg tablets. Therefore, when clinicians initiate therapy with low dose ASA, they may prescribe 1 or 2 tablets of 81mg aspirin per day depending on personal preference and cannot be assisted by evidence to guide their decision.This study aims to determine the incidence of preterm PE or PE with severe features in women taking either 81mg or 162mg in a randomized setting, from a single center. The investigators hypothesize that the information gained from this trial will permit a more accurate sample size calculation for a larger clinical trial powered to accept or reject our testing hypothesis. If our hypothesis is rejected and 162mg of daily ASA is not associated with a lower incidence of severe or preterm PE compared to 81mg, this may be due to lack of power to detect a smaller effect.

83,NCT04783051,Comparison of IST Using Ultra-sensitive Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test and Pyronaridine - Artesunate - PYRAMAXÂ®) to Standard IPT Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to Prevent Malaria in Pregnant Women Living in Endemic Areas,"In endemic settings Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) can sequester in the placenta resulting in low peripheral parasitemia and false negative malaria diagnosis in pregnant women. Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnant women with Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is one of the World Health Organization's recommended malaria control strategies in sub-Saharan African countries. The strategy overcomes the risk of misdiagnosis of malaria in pregnant women by treating them all with SP according to predetermined schedules, but the strategy is now threatened by the spread of Plasmodium parasite resistant strains. As a necessary alternative, Intermittent Screening and Treatment in pregnancy (ISTp), aims on the monthly screening of pregnant women with a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and the treatment of positive cases with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) regardless of the presence of symptoms. The ISTp depends on the performance of the diagnostic tests, and the use of ultrasensitive RDTs (us-RDTs), which have a higher analytical sensitivity than conventional RDTs, should improve the efficacy of the strategy.~Unlike IPTp-SP, ISTp prevents overuse of antimalarials and thus limits drug pressure on malaria parasites. This advantage could be potentiated by using, for pregnant women, an ACT that is not yet used or should not be used in the field for other strata of the population. The recently approved new ACT combination, Pyronaridine - Artesunate (PyramaxÂ®) is the ideal candidate for this purpose.~This study will compare the effects of the ISTp using an us-RDT and PyramaxÂ® (ISTp-US-Py) with the standard IPTp-SP on maternal malaria indicators (malaria infection, parasite density), maternal anemia, spontaneous abortions or intrauterine deaths during pregnancy, fetal morbidity (preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age) and neonatal mortality at delivery in both study groups through conducting a randomized clinical trial enrolling second trimester pregnant women in MaternitÃ© Esengo Health Center, located in Kisenso, Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a malaria perennial transmission area.~The results generated from this study will be essential for the National Malaria Control Program in the selection and implementation of new malaria control policies and addresses the effectiveness of IPTp-SP decline among pregnant women in the DRC.",Female,18 Years,N/A,"Inclusion Criteria:~Gestation â‰¥16 weeks;~Age: â‰¥18 years;~Residence within the health facility catchment area;~Willing to adhere to study requirements and to deliver at the health facility.~Willing to provide written informed consent; if the woman is illiterate, she can choose an impartial witness, not related to the study, to accompany her during the informant consent process and they will both sign the informed consent form~Exclusion Criteria:~Known history of allergy to SP or to an ACT~An ongoing antibioprophylaxis with cotrimoxazole,~Current issue requiring hospital admission (including severe malaria as defined by WHO)~Pregnancy at high risk",Included,The trial explicitly includes pregnant women in the second trimester and aims to compare malaria treatment strategies in this population.,This study will compare the effects of the ISTp using an us-RDT and PyramaxÂ® (ISTp-US-Py) with the standard IPTp-SP on maternal malaria indicators... through conducting a randomized clinical trial enrolling second trimester pregnant women.,1,0,0,5.

97,NCT03553576,The Relationship Between Local Anesthetic Concentration and Volume on Adequate Labor Analgesia With Programmed Intermittent Epidural Bolus,"Neuraxial labor analgesia is performed by the administration of a local anesthetic/opioid mixture in the epidural space. The delivery method is a combination of continuous infusion, provider-administered boluses and patient-administered boluses (patient controlled epidural analgesia [PCEA]) via epidural catheter. Pain during the first stage of labor is primarily due to lower uterine segment and cervical stretching. The pain signals enter the spinal cord through sensory nerves at the T10 through L1 dermatomes. Pain signals from the late first state and second stage of labor also arise from the vagina and perineum. These signals travel with the pudendal nerve and enter the spinal cord at S2-S4. Thus, the anesthetic solution administered through the lumbar epidural catheter must spread cephalad in the epidural space to reach the T10 nerve roots and spinal cord, and must spread caudad to reach the caudal nerve roots in the epidural space.~The optimal method for maintaining labor analgesia is unknown. Several studies have demonstrated that PIEB, in combination with PCEA, provide superior maintenance of labor analgesia (less need and longer time to provider intervention, lower local anesthetic consumption, less motor block, and improved patient satisfaction scores) than maintenance with a continuous infusion with PCEA.The mechanism for this difference is not known; however, one suggested mechanism is improved spread of the local anesthetic within the epidural space. Kaynar et al. injected methylene blue dye through a multi-orifice catheter using either a continuous infusion or intermittent bolus and the area of diffusion was measured on a piece of paper. The authors found that intermittent boluses were associated with a greater surface area of diffusion than continuous infusion. In a cadaver study, dye was injected into the lumbar epidural space, and cryomicrotome sections were taken.Dye flowed in rivulets through small channels in the epidural space, as opposed to moving as a unified front. The authors found dye injected at high pressures had more uniform spread through the epidural space, supporting the concept of intermittent epidural injection providing superior analgesia.~Epidural infusion pumps capable of delivering PIEB of local anesthetic with PCEA have become commercially available and many studies have attempted to assess the optimal parameter settings (including volume of programmed bolus, bolus interval, rate of bolus administration) to provide superior labor analgesia. Recently we completed a double-blinded randomized control trial evaluating two bolus delivery rates, hypothesizing that those patients randomized to receive higher bolus delivery rates would have improved labor analgesia. However, no difference was found between groups.What is more, both groups had a mean cephalad sensory level to cold of T6. This sensory level is higher than the traditional goal of T10 (upper dermatome level of uterine innervation), but despite the adequate sensory level, a large number of patients required supplemental physician-delivered boluses of local anesthetic during labor. Forty percent of the women in the high-rate group and 36% of the low-rate group required a manual re-dose during labor. This suggests that either a higher volume, or higher concentration of local anesthetic (i.e., higher dose) is needed to maintain adequate labor analgesia.~Traditionally higher concentration local anesthetic solutions have been associated with increased motor blockade leading to a higher incidence of instrumental vaginal delivery. Several local anesthetic solutions with varying drug concentrations are available for labor analgesia and are used clinically in the United States. We plan to perform a randomized, controlled, double-blind study to test the hypothesis that patients whose labor analgesia is maintained using PIEB with low-volume bolus (6.25 mL) of a higher local anesthetic concentration solution (0.1% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL) will require less supplemental analgesia (manual provider re-doses) than patients whose PIEB is delivered with a high-volume bolus (10 mL) of lower density local anesthetic solution (0.0625% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL).~The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between bolus volume and concentration of local anesthetic during maintenance of labor analgesia with programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB) analgesia.~The hypothesis of this study is: patients whose labor analgesia is maintained using PIEB with low-volume bolus (6.25 mL) of higher local anesthetic concentration solution (0.1% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL) will have a longer duration of adequate analgesia (time to first manual re-dose request) than patients whose PIEB is delivered with a high-volume bolus (10 mL) of lower concentration local anesthetic solution (0.0625% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL).",Female,18 Years,N/A,Inclusion Criteria:~18 years and above~Nulliparous parturients~Present to the labor and delivery unit for an induction of labor or who are in spontaneous labor~Request neuraxial labor analgesia at â‰¤5 cm cervical dilation~Exclusion Criteria:~Patients who are not eligible to receive a combined spinal epidural (CSE) technique with 25 mcg of intrathecal fentanyl~Non-English speaking~Failed initiation of CSE analgesia (VAS pain score >10 15 minutes after intrathecal dose)~Need to have the epidural catheter replaced during labor~Who deliver within 90 minutes of initiation of labor analgesia~Require re-dose within 90 minutes of initiation of labor analgesia.,Included,The study explicitly includes pregnant individuals as it focuses on labor analgesia for women in labor.,Present to the labor and delivery unit for an induction of labor or who are in spontaneous labor,1,0,0,"16.

Other systems besides bones are affected by vitamin D deficiency, including an increased risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, and certain cancers.~This study proposes to examine and manage vitamin D levels in more than one thousand women in an underserved population in South Carolina. The women will be from the patient population seeking OB/GYN and Pediatric services through Eau Claire Cooperative Health Centers, Inc.

ECCHC is one of approximately 1000 community health centers supported through Health and Human Services' (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA), Bureau of Primary Health Care.~The research objectives for this project will be managed through the Pediatric Nutritional Sciences Research Center of the Children's Research Institute at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, in collaboration with ECCHC. The research aims will evaluate vitamin D levels and possible contributing factors to the levels in pregnant women. Women who present to ECCHC within the first trimester of pregnancy will be randomized to one of two doses of vitamin D supplementation shown to be effective in other groups.

The kidney is the primary site of injury resulting in high blood pressure, loss of protein into the urine and decreased kidney function. The release of vasoconstrictors over vasodilators from an abnormal placenta may underlie pre-eclampsia. Nitric Oxide (NO) is an important vasodilator that is thought to play an important role in the kidneys ability to accommodate to a healthy pregnancy. Normal pregnancy in the rat is accompanied by increased production of NO and its second messenger cGMP. There is a parallel increase in renal expression of constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme that generates NO from arginine. In the pregnant rat, an infusion of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an exogenous inhibitor of NOS, has been shown to replicate some of the hemodynamic features of the syndrome of pre-eclampsia. In a recent animal study, L-arginine supplementation reversed the adverse effects of L-NAME on pregnancy by attenuating the high blood pressure and by significantly decreasing protein loss in the urine. To date, studies of the use of L-arginine supplementation to treat women with pre-eclampsia have been small or uncontrolled and have only assessed blood pressure as a primary outcome measure.

168,NCT04158713,Chemoprevention With Monthly IPTp With Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for Malaria in HIV-infected Pregnant Participants on Daily Cotrimoxazole in Kenya and Malawi: a Multi-centre Placebo-controlled Trial,"2.3.3 Short technical protocol summary Background: Pregnant women represent a vulnerable population for malaria. HIV-infected women are particularly at risk. In HIV-infected pregnant women, WHO recommends daily cotrimoxazole (CTX), an antifolate drug, for malaria chemoprevention and prophylaxis against opportunistic infection. However, there is cross-resistance with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and high levels of antifolate resistance threatens the antimalarial effect of CTX. Recent trials with intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) with mefloquine in HIV-infected women on daily CTX, suggested that chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial markedly improves the protection against malaria compared to daily CTX alone. However, mefloquine was not well tolerated.~The long-acting combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is well tolerated and has shown great promise as IPTp in HIV-negative women in East-Africa. Chemoprevention with monthly DP has also been explored in HIV-infected pregnant women on daily CTX in Uganda. Unfortunately, the study was inconclusive because malaria transmission was too low and a clinically relevant drug interaction with efavirenz (EFV) was found reducing the exposure to DP. WHO now recommends dolutegravir (DTG) based combination antiretroviral therapy (ARTs) as the preferred firstline regimen including for pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. As a result, many countries in Africa are now transitioning to DTG-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cARTs). No such drug-drug interaction is expected between DTG and DP. We will, therefore, assess the safety and efficacy of malaria chemoprevention with monthly DP in HIV-infected women on daily CTX and DTG-based cARTs.~Objectives and methods: This is a 2-arm, individually-randomized, multi-centre, placebo-controlled superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of daily CTX plus monthly DP ('CTX-DP') versus daily CTX plus monthly placebo-DP (i.e. 'CTX-alone', control arm) to reduce malaria and the adverse effects of malaria in 898 (449 per arm) HIV-infected pregnant women on DTG-based cARTs. The study will be conducted in 8 hospitals in Kenya and Malawi in high SP-resistance areas with a high prevalence of malaria. These are the same sites where the sister trial in HIV-uninfected women is being conducted in Kenya and Malawi (IMPROVE trial). Both the mother and baby will be followed for 6-8 weeks after delivery. The study is powered at 80% (alpha=0.05) to detect â‰¥50% relative risk reduction (RR=0.50) in the primary outcome (cumulative incidence of malaria infection) from 12% in the CTX-alone arm (control arm) to 6% in in the interventions arm allowing for 20% non-contributors.

Bupivacaine is currently the standard spinal medication for these procedures because of its long history of safe use, its low incidence of transient neurologic symptoms, and its ability to provide a dependable, dense block with a high degree of maternal satisfaction. While bupivacaine has the aforementioned advantages, it unfortunately has a long duration of action, up to 240-380 minutes, which far exceeds the time necessary to complete most obstetric procedures. ClorotekalÂ®, the first Food and Drug Administration approved chloroprocaine solution created for spinal injection, is a potential alternative.

194,NCT01513447,Intracutaneous Sterile Water Injection as an Adjunct to Neuraxial Labor Analgesia: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"For most women, the most significant pain they will experience is the pain associated with childbirth. Up to one-third of women experience back labor, this typically occurs when the fetus assumes varying degrees of malposition, especially the occiput posterior position, and causes additional constant pressure against the maternal spine and pelvis. Back labor presents as constant pain, that occurs even between contractions. It is often difficult to manage, by the patient, the obstetrician, and the anesthesiologist, and may increase the rate of instrumental and caesarian delivery.~Epidural anesthesia/analgesia is the most common and effective intervention used to help women cope with labor pain. Dilute concentrations of local anesthetic and opioid provide complete analgesia for most women. Some women, however, have breakthrough pain, often due to back labor, and require more concentrated drug solutions. This increases the side effects associated with these drugs (e.g., hypotension, pruritus, motor block), thus treatment of this pain poses a challenge for the anesthesiologist and the obstetrician.~Sterile water injections (SWI) are a simple and well-established method of managing labor pain among midwives. This intervention was first used to alleviate pain associated with kidney stones, and was introduced to obstetrics in the 1970s. Using a syringe, small amounts of sterile water is deposited subcutaneously near the sacral area. The sterile water causes osmotic and mechanical irritation resulting in a brief (15-30 second) and significant stinging sensation. The onset of pain relief follows almost immediately and may last for up to two hours. The procedure can be repeated a number of times.~Sterile water for pain management is most often administered using four intracutaneous injections: two sites lateral to the lumbosacral spine and two sites 2-3 cm below and 1-2 cm medial to the original two injection sites. 0.1 mL of sterile water is injected between the dermal layers to raise a small bleb on the skin surface at each of the four sites. In labor, the injections are administered sequentially during a uterine contraction, with the series of four injections, performed two at a time, completed within 20-30 seconds.~The investigators hypothesize that the use of sterile water injections in women with neuraxial analgesia with breakthrough pain will result in decreased local anesthetic requirements and increase patient satisfaction.",Female,18 Years,60 Years,Inclusion Criteria:~multiparous women~spontaneous labor~at least 18 years of age~presenting for vaginal delivery with cervical dilation of 4 centimeters or less~Exclusion Criteria:~nulliparous~less than 18 years old~contraindication to placement of neuraxial anesthetic~skin infection in area to be injected~medical therapies considered to result in tolerance to opioids~history of chronic pain (requiring regular medical follow-up with pain specialists)~recent use of opioid analgesics (within the year preceding pregnancy),Included,"The trial explicitly includes pregnant women in labor, as it studies pain management during childbirth.",The investigators hypothesize that the use of sterile water injections in women with neuraxial analgesia with breakthrough pain will result in decreased local anesthetic requirements and increase patient satisfaction.,1,0,0,"16.

206,NCT01472549,Antiseptic Skin Preparation for Preventing Surgical Site Infection at Cesarean Delivery: a Randomized Comparative Effectiveness Trial,"The investigators propose a randomized controlled clinical trial to determine the comparative effectiveness of chlorhexidine-alcohol and iodine-alcohol preoperative skin preparation for preventing surgical site infections at cesarean section. While estimates vary, surgical site infections complicate up to 5 - 10% of all cesarean sections and result in significant human suffering and excess health care costs. Interventions such as preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis reduce surgical site infections by 60%, but the rate of infection remains high. There is therefore a great need to identify and test other potential interventions to further reduce these infections.~The skin is a major source of pathogens that cause surgical site infection. Therefore, optimizing preoperative skin antisepsis has the potential to decrease postoperative surgical site infections. There is paucity of evidence to guide the choice of antiseptic for skin preparation at cesarean section. To date, only two underpowered trials have been published comparing two methods of preoperative skin preparation at cesarean section. A recent randomized trial in adults undergoing clean-contaminated mostly general surgical procedures demonstrated a 41% reduction in surgical site infection with the use of chlorhexidine-alcohol when compared to the more commonly used povidone-iodine. While it is plausible that findings from trials in other clean-contaminated surgical procedures may apply to cesarean sections, physiological changes in pregnancy, the peculiar dual microbial source for cesarean-related infections and the hormone-mediated immune-modulation in pregnancy make the validity of such extrapolation uncertain.~The study has the following specific aims:~Primary Aim: To test the hypothesis that preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation at cesarean section significantly reduces surgical site infections compared to iodine-alcohol.~Secondary Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation at cesarean section significantly reduces bacterial contamination at the surgical site compared to iodine-alcohol.~Secondary Aim 2: To determine clinical outcomes and medical costs associated with cesarean-related infections and quantify potential cost savings attributable to use of chlorhexidine-alcohol for preoperative skin preparation at cesarean section.",Female,N/A,N/A,"Inclusion Criteria:~Women undergoing cesarean delivery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.~Exclusion Criteria:~Inability to obtain consent; allergy to chlorhexidine, alcohol, iodine, shellfish; and evidence of infection adjacent to operative site.",Included,The trial explicitly includes pregnant individuals as it involves women undergoing cesarean delivery.,Women undergoing cesarean delivery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.,1,0,0,15.

Among patients having M3s extracted, does the administration of systemic prophylactic antibiotics when compared to placebo, decrease the rate of postoperative inflammatory complications? The first specific aim of the study is to implement a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine if systemic prophylactic antibiotics, when compared to placebo, decrease the rate of postoperative alveolar osteitis (AO) after M3 extraction. For this proposal, postoperative AO is the primary outcome variable.~The second specific aim is to implement a pilot study using a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine if systemic prophylactic antibiotics, when compared to placebo, decrease the rate of postoperative infection after M3 extraction. For the purposes of this proposal, postoperative infection is a secondary outcome variable. Based on sample size estimates, we believe it will be necessary to implement a multi-year trial to address the second specific aim definitively. As such, we will use the experience and preliminary results derived from this clinical trial to develop and implement a future large scale clinical trial.~The third specific aim is to identify risk factors associated with postoperative inflammatory complications in order to develop a model to predict if the prophylactic administration of antibiotics will prevent the postoperative inflammatory complications of alveolar osteitis and infection following the removal of M3's.~The long-term goal of this project is to provide compelling clinical evidence to support recommendations regarding the use of systemic antibiotics in this setting and alter clinical practice based on the results of a well-done, definitive clinical investigation.",All,13 Years,N/A,"Inclusion Criteria:~Demographics: While all ages are eligible for study enrollment, as a practical matter, most patients having M3s removed are usually > 13-14 years of age.~Gender: Males and females will be offered to participate in this study.~Race: All races and ethnicities are eligible for study enrollment.~Clinical status: at least one impacted mandibular third molar ( M3 ) must be scheduled for extraction.~Anesthesia: Patient request that the procedure be executed using intravenous sedation or general anesthesia.

Anomalies of the vaginal flora (bacterial vaginosis, BV) are associated with an increased risk of late abortions and preterm birth. Studies of antibiotic treatment of BV to reduce the risk of prematurity have not found a statistically significant diminution of risk (<= 32 wks: OR=0.49 [0.05-5.1], < 37 wks: OR=0.83 [0.59-1.17]).A partial explanation of these findings is that some of these treatment were administered vaginally, most often during the second or third trimester~Aim: To reduce the frequency of late abortions and very preterm birth by prescribing clindamycin vs placebo to patients diagnosed with BV before 13 weeks.",Female,18 Years,N/A,Inclusion Criteria:~Nugent score >= 7~pregnant women < 15 weeks (strictly)~signed informed consent~>=18 old~speaking and understanding French language~Exclusion Criteria:~metrorrhagias during 7 days before~birth anticipated in an other area~clindamycin allergy,Included,The trial explicitly includes pregnant women less than 15 weeks for the prevention of preterm delivery by treating bacterial vaginosis.,Inclusion Criteria: pregnant women < 15 weeks (strictly),1,0,0,1.

212,NCT03001661,A Randomised Controlled Trial of a Synthetic Osmotic Cervical Dilator for Induction of Labour in Comparison to Dinoprostone Vaginal insErt: the SOLVE Trial,"Induction of labour (where labour is started artificially) is traditionally carried out with a range of different drugs or by surgery (rupturing the membranes or 'waters'). Dilapan-S is a mechanical device, known as an osmotic cervical dilator, which provides an alternative to drugs or surgery. Thin rods of an absorbent material (no active drug present) are inserted into the neck of the womb (cervix) and, as they absorb fluid, they swell and mimic the natural process of 'ripening' (or preparing) the cervix. This initial process is important before contractions begin. Unlike drugs, Dilapan-S does not cause premature contractions that, when too frequent, may cause the baby to become distressed. The project will compare cervical ripening using Dilapan-S with the standard use prostaglandin drug. Women with a single pregnancy, who require induction of labour, and who are not considered high risk, will be invited to participate. Investigators hope to recruit 860 women from UK maternity units over 2 years. Participants will have an equal chance of being randomised to the drug, which is standard practice, or the cervical dilator. The speed in which labour commences, the mode of delivery and any side effects will be compared. Importantly, investigators shall also assess patient satisfaction and anxiety during the induction process, by asking participants to complete a short questionnaire about their experience before they go home after having their baby. If osmotic dilators are effective investigators expect NICE to consider them an option alongside other cervical ripening methods.",Female,16 Years,N/A,Inclusion criteria~Women must meet the following criteria prior to initiation of IoL:~â‰¥ 16 years of age~Able to provide informed consent~Singleton pregnancy~Indication for IoL~Pregnancy â‰¥ 37.0 weeks (assessed as an agreed gestational age by ultrasound dating scan)~Living fetus with vertex presentation~Intact membranes~Exclusion criteria~Women already receiving oxytocin~Diagnosis of fulminant preeclampsia / eclampsia~Contraindication to DINOPROSTONE or DILAPAN~If DINOPROSTONE for IoL is non-compliant with local policy~Enrolled in other randomised controlled trials of an IMP or device for cervical ripening or induction of labour,Included,The trial explicitly includes pregnant women who require induction of labor and are not considered high risk.

53,NCT03727971,"Use of Omalizumab Will Increase the Pregnancy Rate, Proof of Concept Study, Where Women With Asthma and Infertility Will be Treated Three Times With Weight and IgE Balanced Dosis at the First Day of Their Period Bleeding","The investigators have previously confirmed a clinical hunch that women with asthma have difficulties in becoming pregnant. The investigators found increased time to pregnancy (TTP) in women with asthma compared to non-asthmatic women (55 vs 33 months, p<0.001), furthermore, women with asthma had less successful pregnancies following fertility treatment (39.6 vs 60.4%, p=0.002). Treatment with omalizumab stabilizes the eosinophilic disease, through the systemic and most likely the anti-inflammatory pathways, which indicate a promising possibility to increase pregnancy rate. In a small real-life study in 2017, 5 patients with eosinophilic asthma who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF), were treated with omalizumab prior to embryo transplantation; three out of the five women became pregnant. Lastly, the two remaining patients had several treatments with omalizumab, but did not become pregnant. This real-life study calls for further investigation. By targeting systemic inflammation with omalizumab treatment the aim is to increase asthma control before and during pregnancy. A treatment strategy aiming at improving overall inflammatory control may increase fertility, but also reduce well known maternal and perinatal adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low-birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), preterm delivery.~Study design:~A randomized control trial with omalizumab and placebo, stratified for blood eosinophil count, is therefore needed. A randomized, double blinded, parallel group, study to evaluate the difference between omalizumab (O) and placebo (P) on pregnancy rate in patients with atopic asthma.Treatment schedule: After collection of material (blood samples, sputum) 6th day (Â±1 day) of the menstrual cycle, the patients will be randomized in either the omalizumab group or the placebo group. No collection of material will be done at the time of enrollment, as this will be on different time of the female cycles. The treatment is initiated with one injection with weight and serum-immunglobulin E balanced omalizumab or one injection placebo. After omalizumab treatment at ovulation it will again be collected material (blood samples, sputum). If no pregnancy has occurred after first IVF cycle, this will be repeated for 3 consecutive IVF cycles in total or until pregnancy has occurred.~Outcome:~The primary out-come is efficacy of omalizumab, compared to placebo, in increasing pregnancy rate in females with asthma.
