"1","NCT06100432",2023,"Effect of Eurycoma Longifolia (DLBS5055) and Multivitamins (Vitamin C+Vitamin E+ β-carotene) on Sperm Parameters and Reproductive Hormones of Infertile Males in Yogyakarta, Indonesia","Infertility is defined as the inability of a couple to get pregnant after one year of regular and unprotected sexual intercourse. Although it is not a life-threatening condition, infertile couple often suffer from mental health issues, including depression and low self-esteem that may impact their Quality of Life (QoL). Male factors contribute to a half of the underlying causes of infertility and semen analysis play a vital role in investigation of the fertility status of the male partners. By performing semen analysis, we could predict the chance of a couple to conceive.~Male infertility treatments include surgery, hormonal treatment and also assisted reproductive techniques, such as intra uterine insemination and in vitro fertilization that may lead to a financial burden for infertile couple. For facing this issue, traditional or herbal medicine and antioxidants are often be used as an alternative way by many infertile couples. One of the traditional medicines used in Indonesia and other Southeast-Asia Countries for infertility cases is Eurycoma longifolia or Pasak Bumi.~Based on previous studies in animals, Eurycoma longifolia could improve Testosterone and may improve sperm parameters, even though there are very few studies in human including in Indonesia. Antioxidants (multivitamins) are also routinely given to the infertile men as they could protect sperm damages from oxidative stress and may in advanced improve sperm quantity and quality. Our study aims to compare the effect of Eurycoma longifolia, Multivitamins and the combination on sperm parameters and also reproductive hormones of the infertile males.","Inclusion Criteria:~Male with idiopathic infertility~Age 20-45 years~Married and try to conceive.~Being registered with the Indonesian Social Health Insurance Administration Body (BPJS).~Has sperm concentration more than 5 million per mL.~Has testosterone level between 350-600 ng/dl.~Withdraw from any antioxidant treatment for at least 14 days before the enrollment of the study.~Able to understand and provide Informed Consent~Exclusion Criteria:~Has a varicocele and other metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus.~Has a history of surgery or injury in the genital region.~Has a history of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.~Has a known allergy to any ingredients of the active or placebo material of the tested drugs (Eurycoma longifolia, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Beta-carotene).~Has a history of hormonal therapy in the last 6 months.~Consumes any herbal or traditional medicine.~Consumes any medicine contains steroid.","male infertility",1,"The study is directly related to fertility as it investigates the effects of Eurycoma longifolia and multivitamins on sperm parameters and reproductive hormones in infertile males.","Our study aims to compare the effect of Eurycoma longifolia, Multivitamins and the combination on sperm parameters and also reproductive hormones of the infertile males."

Low testosterone can be caused by pain medication effects on part of the brain (hypothalamic-pituitary axis) which ultimately result in decreased testosterone production by the testes. Typical symptoms of low testosterone (hypogonadism) may include decreased muscle mass, increased fat, osteoporosis, anemia, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation. In addition, men with low testosterone may experience decreased attention, and decreased libido, fatigue, and depressed mood. Few studies have looked at hormonal changes caused by long-term opioid usage in men.~Clomiphene citrate, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) oral medication which inhibits estrogen effects (feedback) on the brain, has been identified by prior studies to raise testosterone in men with low testosterone (due to reasons other than chronic pain medication). Clomiphene citrate is also known to lead to increased sperm production in men with low testosterone unlike testosterone topical or injection medications.

"28","NCT02421887",2015,"Males, Antioxidants, and Infertility (MOXI) Trial","The objective of the Males, Antioxidants, and Infertility (MOXI) Trial is to examine whether treatment of infertile males with an antioxidant formulation improves male fertility. The central hypothesis is that treatment of infertile males with antioxidants will improve sperm structure and function, resulting in higher fertilization rates and improved embryo development, leading to higher pregnancy and live birth rates. Findings from this research will be significant in that they will likely lead to an effective, non-hormonal treatment modality for male infertility. An effective treatment for men would also reduce the treatment burden on the female partner, lower costs, and provide effective alternatives to couples with religious or ethical contraindications to ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology). If antioxidants do not improve pregnancy rates, but do improve sperm motility and DNA integrity, they could allow for couples with male factor infertility to use less intensive therapies such as intrauterine insemination. Male fertility specialists currently prescribe antioxidants based on the limited data supporting their use. A negative finding, lack of any benefit, would also alter current treatment of infertile males.","Inclusion Criteria:Couple~12 or more months of infertility (primary or secondary)~Heterosexual~Cohabitating and able to have regular intercourse~Male:~≥ 18 years of age~At least one abnormal semen parameter on a semen analysis within the past 6 months:~Sperm concentration ≤15 Million/ml~Total motility ≤40%~Normal morphology (Kruger) ≤4%~DNA fragmentation (SCSA, DNA fragmentation index) >25%~Female:~≥18 years of age and ≤40 years of age~For women ≥ 35 years of age, evidence of normal ovarian reserve as assessed by menstrual cycle day 3 (+/-2 days) FSH ≤10 IU/L with estradiol ≤ 70 pg/mL, AMH ≥ 1.0 ng/mL, OR antral follicle count >10 within one year prior to study initiation.~Evidence of at least one patent fallopian tube as determined by an hysterosalpingogram or laparoscopy showing at least one patent fallopian tube or a saline infusion sonogram showing spillage of contrast material~Regular cycles defined as ≥25 days and ≤35 days in duration~Evidence of ovulation including biphasic basal body temperatures, positive ovulation predictor kits, or progesterone level ≥3 ng/ml.~Exclusion Criteria:~Couple:~Previous sterilization procedures (vasectomy, tubal ligation).
