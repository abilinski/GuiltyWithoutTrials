2,NCT04871425,Ketamine Versus Fentanyl for Surgical Abortions: A Randomized Controlled Noninferiority Trial,"Ketamine is commonly used for procedural sedation and analgesia. It is widely used for trauma cases in the emergency department and is considered a superior agent in the outpatient setting due to its lack of respiratory and cardiovascular depression. In chronic opioid users, ketamine decreases acute pain and reduces postoperative opioid consumption. Few studies have examined the use of ketamine for surgical abortions. Previous studies found significant rates of emergence phenomena; however, this can be prevented if a benzodiazepine is given at the same time. Ketamine deserves further study to determine whether it is an acceptable alternative to a standard opioid-based regimen for surgical abortion. Our primary objective is to compare patient satisfaction after surgical abortion among patients receiving IV ketamine versus IV fentanyl for procedural sedation. Our secondary objectives include postoperative pain, additional pain medication used, and postoperative opioid use after the procedure. Our hypothesis is that ketamine will provide similar patient satisfaction and reduce postoperative opioid use. This will be a randomized controlled noninferiority clinical trial of 84 women receiving either IV ketamine with IV midazolam or IV fentanyl with IV midazolam for outpatient one day surgical abortions up to 13, 6/7 weeks gestation. Both groups will receive a standardized paracervical block and additional pain medication as needed. Our study has the potential to introduce IV ketamine as a satisfactory medication for outpatient surgical abortions. Ketamine may decrease the need for IV fentanyl, reduce postoperative opioid use, and may prove to be a superior analgesic for chronic opioid users.",Inclusion Criteria:~Aged 14 years or older~Voluntarily requesting surgical pregnancy termination~Intrauterine pregnancy up to 13 weeks 6 days by transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasound performed on day of procedure~Eligible for suction curettage~English or Spanish speaking~Able and willing to give informed consent and agree to terms of the study~Exclusion Criteria:~Age less than 14 years~Reaspiration procedure or failed medication abortion~Early pregnancy loss~Alcohol use disorder or acute alcohol intoxication~Currently incarcerated~Gestational age 14 weeks or more~Requesting a specific pain regimen~Premedication with misoprostol~Contraindications or allergies to ketamine or fentanyl,"abortion in first trimester~pain, procedural~opioid use",1,Our primary objective is to compare patient satisfaction after surgical abortion among patients receiving IV ketamine versus IV fentanyl for procedural sedation.,1,

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate and dactinomycin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

6,NCT00617097,Paracervical Block With Ketorolac and Lidocaine in First Trimester Surgical Abortions,"The investigators primary objective is to study the analgesic effects of combined ketorolac and lidocaine in a paracervical block compared to preoperative ibuprofen followed by intra-operative paracervical block with lidocaine alone on women undergoing first trimester surgical abortions. The investigators hypothesize that women who receive a paracervical block of combined ketorolac and lidocaine will experience less pain during the procedure based on a visual analog scale (VAS) compared to those who receive preoperative ibuprofen and a paracervical block with lidocaine alone.~This randomized, multi-site, placebo-controlled clinical trial will investigate the difference in perceived pain from first trimester surgical abortions using a paracervical block of combined ketorolac and lidocaine compared to preoperative ibuprofen and paracervical block with lidocaine alone. A total of fifty women who are seeking elective surgical abortions of intrauterine pregnancies less than 11 0/7 weeks' gestation will be recruited from Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Planned Parenthood of Maryland in Baltimore, Maryland and Planned Parenthood Columbia-Willamette in Portland, Oregon. Pain before, during, and after surgical abortion will be measured using a 100-mm VAS.~The primary outcome of interest is the mean difference in pain level from preoperative baseline to time after cervical dilation comparing the treatment groups. If the investigators see greater pain reduction associated with the paracervical block of lidocaine and ketorolac, adoption of this regimen may improve pain management during first trimester surgical abortions. If combined ketorolac and lidocaine when administered as a paracervical block is proven to be efficacious, the need for additional analgesia in first trimester surgical abortions can be minimized.","Inclusion Criteria:~age greater than or equal to 18 years~English-speaking~ability and willingness to sign the informed consent~ability and willingness to comply with the terms of the study~voluntary request for pregnancy termination~ultrasound-confirmed singleton intrauterine pregnancy with an estimated gestational age not exceeding 76 days (10 6/7 weeks) from the first day of the preceding menstrual cycle~Exclusion Criteria:~women who require or request sedation~untreated acute cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease~contraindications to lidocaine such as allergy to lidocaine, cardiac arrhythmia or heart block, and porphyria~allergic reaction or sensitivity to lorazepam or NSAIDs~chronic NSAID use~history of gastritis or gastric ulcer~acute renal failure or chronic renal disease~chronic liver disease~history of bleeding diathesis~chronic narcotic use~current or past history of illegal drug use (excluding marijuana)",pain~surgical abortion,1,elective surgical abortions of intrauterine pregnancies less than 11 0/7 weeks' gestation,1,

10,NCT04254081,Addition of Buprenorphine to Paracervical Block Prior to Osmotic Dilator Insertion for Dilation and Evacuation: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Cervical preparation with osmotic dilators is commonly used prior to dilation and evacuation (D&E) procedures to decrease the risk of complications. Women have described the pain of osmotic dilator insertion as moderate to severe yet there have been few studies aimed at addressing pain during and after osmotic dilator insertion. In addition to the discomfort during insertion, pain after osmotic dilator insertion peaks at 2 hours post-insertion with use of a lidocaine paracervical block. One randomized trial found that use of a paracervical block with 1% buffered lidocaine decreased pain with osmotic dilator insertion compared to a sham block. There are adjunct treatments to optimize analgesia with local anesthetics at a variety of anatomic locations. Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, has been found to increase the quality of the anesthetic at the time of administration and increase the duration of nerve block analgesia at several anatomic sites, though has never been studied as an adjunct in a paracervical block. This has been used extensively in orthopedic surgery with significant prolongation of the local anesthetic effect by almost threefold in some studies.~Primary Aim: To compare the mean pain score at the time of osmotic dilator insertion among women randomized to a 1% lidocaine and buprenorphine paracervical block compared to a 1% lidocaine paracervical block alone.~Secondary Aim: To compare the mean pain score 2 hours after osmotic dilator insertion among women randomized to a lidocaine and buprenorphine paracervical block compared to a lidocaine paracervical block alone.~The investigators hypothesize that in patients undergoing osmotic dilator insertion in preparation for dilation and evacuation, the addition of buprenorphine 0.15mg to a 1% lidocaine paracervical block will be associated with lower mean pain scores at time of osmotic dilator insertion compared to women who receive a 1% lidocaine paracervical block alone.","Inclusion Criteria:~Gestational age 14 0/7 weeks to 23 6/7 weeks at time of osmotic dilator insertion~Require cervical preparation with placement of osmotic dilators~At least 18 years of age~Fluent in English or Spanish~Exclusion Criteria:~Same day dilation and evacuation procedure~Request for sedation during osmotic dilator insertion~Liver disease~Allergy to buprenorphine, lidocaine, or ibuprofen~Narcotic or opioid medication use in the preceding 24 hours~Use of recreational/illicit medications in the preceding 24 hours~Currently incarcerated","procedural pain~buprenorphine~adjuvants, anesthesia~dilation and evacuation~analgesics",1,Cervical preparation with osmotic dilators is commonly used prior to dilation and evacuation (D&E) procedures to decrease the risk of complications.,1,

14,NCT02456662,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Scheduled Prophylactic Antiemetics for Reduction of Emesis With Doxycycline,"Background/Purpose of the Study Doxycycline is an antibiotic used for infection prevention before surgical pregnancy termination, and a side effect of it is nausea/vomiting. The investigators' study explores whether or not taking the anti-emetic ondansetron prior to doxycycline decreases rates of nausea/vomiting. Patients enrolled in the investigators' study will take either ondansetron or a placebo before they take doxycycline to see if ondansetron decreases their nausea/vomiting. Reducing nausea/vomiting may prevent more infections, and decrease the rates of general anesthesia, patient risks and hospital costs. Decreasing nausea/vomiting will also improve patient experience.~Study Design This will be a randomized controlled trial. Data will be collected by administrating surveys and a log where patients will record the timing of their medications and episodes of nausea/vomiting.

16,NCT02141555,Comparing Buccal and Vaginal Misoprostol in Management of Early Pregnancy Loss: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"First trimester miscarriages are common. When the failed pregnancy does not pass spontaneously on its own, it is called a missed abortion. There are several ways in which missed abortions are managed, one of which involves administering a medication called misoprostol which causes uterine contractions inducing expulsion of the failed pregnancy. Misoprostol can be administered in multiple ways but has been traditionally inserted vaginally when used for management of missed abortions. Some studies have shown that some women are not comfortable with vaginal insertion of misoprostol and prefer oral administration. Buccal misoprostol is a way of administering misoprostol by having the patients insert the tablets of misoprostol between their gum and cheek, letting it dissolve for 30 minutes, then swallowing the remaining remnants. Buccal misoprostol is used safely in medical abortion. In fact a study by Fjerstad et al (2009), found a decrease in infection rate for medical abortion when misoprostol administration was switched from vaginal to buccal route combined with routine administration of doxycycline. The efficacy of using buccal misoprostol to treat missed abortions has not been studied previously to the investigators' knowledge. In this pilot study, investigators aim to test the hypotheses that buccal misoprostol is equally effective as vaginal misoprostol in the medical management of early pregnancy loss. As secondary outcomes, investigators suspect that buccal misoprostol may be associated with higher rates of gastrointestinal side effect but that patient satisfaction will remain equally as high for buccal misoprostol as for vaginal misoprostol.","Inclusion Criteria:~Women ages 18-50 who are English or Spanish speaking~First trimester pregnancy (less than 13 weeks and 0 days)~Desires medical management of an early pregnancy loss with misoprostol~Diagnosed with an early pregnancy failure by UCSD Radiology or diagnosed early pregnancy failure defined by any of the following criteria (Bourne 2013):~Crown-rump length > 7mm with no cardiac activity~Mean gestational sac diameter of > 25 mm and no embryo~Absence of an embryo with heartbeat > 2 weeks after a scan showing a gestational sac without a yolk sac~Absence of embryo with heartbeat > 11 days after a scan showing a gestational sac with a yolk sac~Exclusion Criteria:~Evidence of infection, acute hemorrhage, or hemodynamic instability~Hemoglobin less than 9.5 including use of point of care Hgb testing~Known allergy to misoprostol~Underwent surgical or medical abortion during current pregnancy~Currently breastfeeding~Currently has intrauterine device in place~Suspicion of ectopic or gestational trophoblastic disease~History of clotting disorder or on anticoagulant therapy (excluding aspirin)~Unreliable for follow up",spontaneous abortion in first trimester,1,"When the failed pregnancy does not pass spontaneously on its own, it is called a missed abortion.

34,NCT01636063,Mifepristone Versus Misoprostol for Cervical Preparation Prior to Surgical Abortion Between 11 to 15 Weeks,"Surgical abortion in the late first trimester and early second trimester is usually performed with the aid of a cervical preparing agent, which helps to open up the uterine cervix for the procedure. Routine use of cervical preparants is recommended by several organizations during this period of pregnancy before surgical abortion, especially in younger women or those who have not delivered a baby, because their cervices may be more difficult to dilate without a preparant.~The standard medication used for cervical preparation is misoprostol. Unfortunately, misoprostol may cause uncomfortable uterine cramping and vaginal bleeding in patients who use it. Another medication called mifepristone has been shown to dilate the cervix better than misoprostol in the first trimester, but little information exists about using mifepristone in the late first trimester and early second trimester.~The investigators plan to perform a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate if mifepristone is a better cervical preparant than misoprostol. A total of 110 participants who are pregnant women desiring pregnancy termination 11 to 15 weeks gestational age will be recruited. Half will receive mifepristone and the other half misoprostol. The investigators will measure the amount of cervical dilation achieved right before a surgical abortion to determine if mifepristone is significantly different than misoprostol as a cervical preparant at this stage of pregnancy. The investigators expect that mifepristone will work better than misoprostol for this purpose.~The investigators hope to generate information about mifepristone so that women and their health care providers can know more about mifepristone as an option for cervical preparation before surgical abortion.","Inclusion Criteria:~Age greater or equal to 18 years~Fluency in English or Spanish~Intrauterine pregnancy between 11 0/7 and 15 0/7 on the day of the abortion procedure~Desire for pregnancy termination~Ability to return for abortion procedure 24-48 hours after the preoperative visit~Exclusion Criteria:~Allergy or contraindication to study agents~Requirement of general anesthesia to perform the abortion~Diagnosis of missed abortion, spontaneous abortion, incomplete abortion, or threatened abortion at time of initial preoperative evaluation",induced abortion~abortion techniques~mifepristone~misoprostol,1,"The investigators plan to perform a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate if mifepristone is a better cervical preparant than misoprostol.

The investigator's prior work demonstrated that compared to placebo, a single dose of cabergoline was effective in preventing breast symptoms after abortion or loss 18-28 weeks. As lactogenesis starts as early as 16 weeks gestation, the investigators hope to determine the efficacy of cabergoline earlier in the second trimester,16-20 weeks.","Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant people, ages 18 years or older~Intrauterine pregnancy between 16/0-19/6 weeks of gestation age (by ultrasound dating performed prior to or same day of enrollment visit)~Consented for an induced, elective abortion or undergoing management of fetal demise~English or Spanish speaking~Able to consent for a research study, literate in English or Spanish~Willing to comply with study procedures and follow-up~Access to smart phone throughout study~Exclusion Criteria:~18 Years Female No No~Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant people, ages 18 years or older~Intrauterine pregnancy between 18/0-28/0 weeks of gestation age (by ultrasound dating performed prior to or same day of enrollment visit)~Consented for an induced, elective abortion or undergoing induction for demise~English or Spanish speaking~Able to consent for a research study, literate in English or Spanish~Willing to comply with study procedures and follow-up~Access to smart phone throughout study~Exclusion Criteria:~Prior mastectomy (breast reduction or chest masculinization surgery acceptable)~Currently breastfeeding~Currently receiving dopamine agonist or antagonist therapy for other indication leg syndrome)~Contraindication to cabergoline (as per package insert)~Uncontrolled hypertension - defined as baseline BP > 160/110, or chronic hypertension requiring more than one baseline medication, or current pregnancy-induced hypertension spectrum disorders (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia)~History of cardiac valvular disorders or valvular repair~History of pulmonary, pericardial, or retroperitoneal fibrotic disorders",lactation suppressed,1,"Consented for an induced, elective abortion or undergoing management of fetal demise",1,

However, in the setting of many pregnancy complications, decreasing time from diagnosis of nonviable pregnancy to delivery is of utmost importance to decrease risk of maternal complications.

Several studies have investigated different methods of delivering cervical anesthesia prior to abortion, however to the best of the investigators' knowledge, there is no published data that 1) rigorously examines the effect of a time interval between local anesthetic administration and procedure initiation, or 2) explores whether adequate pain relief is possible through self-administered, non-invasive means alone. Research in this area has a significant public health impact, given the large number of women worldwide who seek abortions.~The investigators propose to explore the effect of a locally applied vaginal lidocaine gel in place of the traditional paracervical block prior to first trimester surgical abortion.

60,NCT01862991,Protocol Title: Reducing Complications and Patient Barriers in Second Trimester Abortion: Pre-Operative Effects of Mifepristone (POEM) on Dilatation and Evacuation Services,"This research study investigates the use of a drug, mifepristone, given before second trimester abortion. Mifepristone is a medication that is approved for medical abortion during the first trimester. It also has been used prior to abortion in the early seconds trimester (14-16 weeks gestation) and for medication abortion in the second trimester (also called induction abortion). This medication has effects on the uterus that may help dilate, or open, the cervix. Abortion requires opening of the cervix to safely remove the pregnancy. Cervical dilation, or opening, is essential to both ease of completion of procedure and reducing complications that can occur. These complications include laceration, or tearing, of the cervix and perforation of the uterus (a hole made unintentionally in the muscle wall of the uterus) and are not expected to be increased in the study. Dilation of the cervix is usually achieved by placing thin rods (cervical dilators) through the cervix. These rods then absorb the moisture of the vagina and slowly expand, opening the cervix. The standard method of dilation is performed at the clinic and involves the placement of cervical dilators the day before the procedure. This procedure can be uncomfortable. A prior study showed that mifepristone reduces the number of osmotic dilators that need to be placed prior to the procedure after 19 weeks gestation. We aim to investigate mifepristone as a potential adjunct to cervical dilation or used alone, without dilators, as method of cervical preparation with the hopes of reducing barriers imposed by painful procedures and time in clinic and away from work/home that the current approach involving dilators requires.","Inclusion Criteria:~>18 years old~Viable, Singleton pregnancy~Voluntarily seeking abortion between 19 and 24 wks gestation~Able to give informed consent and comply with study protocol~Fluent in English or Spanish~Exclusion Criteria:~Allergy to misoprostol or mifepristone",legally induced abortion without mention of complication,1,"This research study investigates the use of a drug, mifepristone, given before second trimester abortion.",1,

The dilators are put in during a pelvic exam in the clinic and after women go home they expand slowly overnight to open the cervix before the abortion procedure the next day. This can be a painful experience and health care providers often give women different kinds of pain medicine to help them.~The investigators are interested in whether a medicine called gabapentin, which is a non-narcotic medicine, could help. Gabapentin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of seizures and for treating nerve pain and doctors are also using it to decrease pain for people having surgical procedures.~The main goals of our study are to learn about:~Women's pain experience with dilators in their cervix overnight before the abortion procedure~How well gabapentin works to decrease women's pain while they have the dilators in their cervix~Women who enroll in the study will get a dose of either gabapentin or placebo (a pill with no medicine in it) before their dilators are placed in the clinic.

This is known as a pregnancy of unknown location. These patients most likely have a pregnancy in the uterus that is too early to be seen on ultrasound, but it is possible that the pregnancy is not seen inside the uterus because it is outside of the uterus, known as an ectopic pregnancy. Patients with ectopic pregnancies are at risk for serious complications, and the medications used for medication abortion may not end an ectopic pregnancy.~Currently, at Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts (PPLM), patients seeking medication abortion, including some patients with a pregnancy of unknown location, are given mifepristone to begin the medication abortion at the clinic and then one dose of misoprostol to take at home to cause the pregnancy to pass. However, research suggests that a second dose of misoprostol leads to a higher rate of completed abortion for certain patients.~This research is being conducted to learn if two doses of the at-home misoprostol during the medication abortion process leads to a higher rate of completed abortion for patients with pregnancy of unknown location.

The benefit of stopping milk leakage has also been studied and used in populations who shouldn't breastfeed. The investigators aim to clarify if cabergoline is effective in preventing breast engorgement and milk leakage after second-trimester abortions or perinatal loss (stillbirth). Breast engorgement causes physical pain and emotional distress as lactation is uniquely associated with parenthood and those undergoing second-trimester abortions are doing so because they choose not to parent or a previously desired pregnancy is now complicated by anomalies. As there are no current recommendations for management of this painful engorgement beyond icepacks and support bras, the investigators aim to validate the use of this pharmacologic option in this setting.","Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant people, ages 18 years or older~Intrauterine pregnancy between 18/0-28/0 weeks of gestation age (by ultrasound dating performed prior to or same day of enrollment visit)~Consented for an induced, elective abortion or undergoing induction for demise~English or Spanish speaking~Able to consent for a research study, literate in English or Spanish~Willing to comply with study procedures and follow-up~Access to smart phone throughout study~Exclusion Criteria:~Prior mastectomy (breast reduction or chest masculinization surgery acceptable)~Currently breastfeeding~Currently receiving dopamine agonist therapy for other indication (prolactinoma, Cushings syndrome, acromegaly, restless leg syndrome)~Contraindication to cabergoline (as per package insert)~Uncontrolled hypertension - defined as baseline BP > 150/100, or chronic hypertension requiring more than one baseline medication, or pregnancy-induced hypertension spectrum disorders (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia)~History of cardiac valvular disorders or valvular repair~History of pulmonary, pericardial, or retroperitoneal fibrotic disorders",lactation suppressed,1,The investigators aim to clarify if cabergoline is effective in preventing breast engorgement and milk leakage after second-trimester abortions or perinatal loss (stillbirth).,1,
