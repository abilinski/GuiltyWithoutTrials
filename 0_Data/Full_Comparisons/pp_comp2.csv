Twin gestations (twin pregnancy) are at particularly higher risk for postpartum hemorrhage, yet the management of obstetrical bleeding following twin delivery remains identical to singleton delivery.~The purpose of this study is to understand the effect of prophylactic methylergonovine on blood loss in scheduled twin pregnancy cesarean deliveries. Participants will be randomized (like tossing a coin) to Methylergonovine (investigational drug) or water with salt (saline) (placebo). Methylergonovine or saline will be given as an injection immediately after delivery.","Inclusion Criteria:~Twin gestation~Scheduled cesarean delivery (>=34 weeks)~Exclusion criteria:~Patients with known hypertensive disease: history of chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension or preeclampsia with or without severe features~Use of protease inhibitors given known vasoconstrictive side effects with concomitant methylergonovine administration~Hypersensitivity to methylergonovine or any of the ingredients~Participating in another intervention study where the primary outcome includes postpartum bleeding or thromboembolism, or the study intervention directly affects postpartum bleeding or thromboembolism~Receipt of uterotonics, other than oxytocin, or planned or expected use of uterotonic prophylaxis~Non-elective cesarean delivery","Postpartum intervention","Methylergonovine or saline will be given as an injection immediately after delivery.",0,1,"Methylergonovine or saline will be given as an injection immediately after delivery."

"6","NCT01192035","PI or NNRTI as First-line Treatment of HIV in a West African Population With Low Adherence - the PIONA Trial","BACKGROUND: Since 1996 the combination of three or more drugs has been the mainstay of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. The most important types of drugs are called nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) Response to treatment is measured as increasing CD4+ cell count and decreasing HIV viral load. A major problem is the development of resistance. NNRTIs are recommended as part of first-line treatment of HIV in Africa but many Africans have a slower NNRTI clearance than Caucasians making them more susceptible for development of resistance in case of treatment interruptions. PIs might therefore be a better option in an African setting with low adherence.~AIM: To evaluate two different treatment regimens in HIV-1 infected patients:~A) A NNRTI (efavirenz/nevirapine) based regimen and B) A PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir) based regimen with regard to treatment outcomes. HYPOTHESIS: Treatment with a PI will be superior to treatment with a NNRTI due to less development of resistance.~METHODS: Treatment-naïve adult HIV-1 patients enrolled in an existing cohort The West African Retrovirus and Acquired Immune Deficiency (WARAID) cohort in Guinea Bissau with CD4+ cell count ≤ 350 cells/µL and/or clinical signs of immune suppression (World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage 3 or 4) will be randomised 1:1 to: Treatment A: 2 NRTIs (lamivudine and either zidovudine or stavudine) and 1 NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine) or Treatment B: 2 NRTIs (same as in treatment A) and 1 PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir). Primary outcome: Viral load suppression <400 copies/ml 12 months after enrolment.~PERSPECTIVES: Guidelines for treatment of HIV in Africa are more or less a copy of the guidelines used in Europe and North America. Genetic differences in pharmacokinetics, more women infected in Africa and difficulties ensuring good adherence mean that results obtained from Caucasian patients are not directly transferrable to African patients. The results of this study will hopefully help guiding the treatment of HIV in Africa in the future. The investigators believe the HIV infected people in West Africa deserve the same evidence-based medicine as in developed countries.","Inclusion Criteria:~Antiretroviral treatment (ART) naïve HIV-1 infected patients. Women receiving ART during pregnancy can be included.~Age ≥ 18 years~CD4+ cell count ≤ 350 cells/µL and/or~Clinical signs of immune suppression (WHO clinical stage 3 or 4) irrespective of CD4+ cell count.~Exclusion Criteria:~Tuberculosis (TB) treatment with rifampicin at the time of enrolment.~Co-infection with HIV-2.~Grade 3 or 4 alanine transaminase (ALAT) elevation (>5 times upper normal limit).~Patients with cerebral disturbances that complicates the ability to give informed consent or follow the treatment regime.","Neither","0",1,0,"Women receiving ART during pregnancy can be included."
"7","NCT01061151","Breastfeeding Version of the PROMISE Study (Promoting Maternal and Infant Survival Everywhere)","The purpose of this study was to examine, in an integrated and comprehensive fashion, three critical questions currently facing HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women and their infants:~What is the optimal intervention for the prevention of antepartum and intrapartum transmission of HIV?~What is the optimal intervention for the prevention of postpartum transmission in breastfeeding (BF) infants?~What is the optimal intervention for the preservation of maternal health after the risk period for prevention of mother-to-child-transmission ends (either at delivery or cessation of BF)?~The overall PROMISE protocol had three separate interventional components to address each of these three questions and was conducted at locations in Africa and other parts of the world. Due to variations in the standard of care for HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women and their infants at different sites, not all of these questions were relevant. Therefore, two separate versions of the PROMISE protocol were developed, each containing only the relevant components. The 1077BF protocol was used at sites where the standard method of infant feeding was breastfeeding, whereas the 1077FF protocol was used at sites where the standard method of infant feeding was formula feeding. The analyses were collapsed across the two protocol versions, and therefore the summaries contain the results of the 1077BF and/or the 1077FF protocols.","Antepartum Component Inclusion Criteria:~Confirmed HIV-1 infection, defined as documented positive results from two samples collected at different time points prior to study entry.

"10","NCT00858832","Reduction of Endometritis After Cesarean Section With the Routine Use of Methergine","Endomyometritis is an infection in the uterus. It can occur in up to 1 out of 5 women having unplanned cesarean deliveries. Antibiotics are routinely given at the time of Cesarean delivery, but the infection in the uterus can still occur. When endomyometritis occurs it can prolong the woman's stay in the hospital after birth, slow down her recovery time at home, and increase medical costs. Methergine is a medication that is routinely used to stop uterine hemorrhage (excessive bleeding from the uterus) that sometimes happens after delivery. Methergine works by contracting (tightening) the uterus. These contractions also help the uterus to expel or remove parts of the placenta that increase the chance of developing a uterine infection.~This research study is being done to learn if routine use of Methergine can lower the chances of developing a uterine infection after cesarean delivery. Half of the women in this study will receive Methergine for a few days during their hospitalization after cesarean delivery.

"59","NCT02216383","Intramuscular Oxytocics: A Randomised Control Trial of Intramuscular Carbetocin, Syntocinon and Syntometrine for the Third Stage of Labour Following Vaginal Birth","A quarter of all pregnancy and child-birth related deaths are due to excessive bleeding after the birth, post-partum haemorrhage (PPH). In the UK, PPH affects approx 10% of new mothers. PPH can be frightening for women and cause them to need additional treatments prolonging their hospital stay.~Commonly PPH is caused by an inadequately contracted womb after childbirth. Giving the mother an injection of uterotonic medicine following the birth of their baby can prevent this. It reduces the risk of PPH by 66%.~In the UK, the two medicines most commonly used are Syntocinon and Syntometrine. Syntometrine is longer acting, but a published review of trials concluded that Syntometrine is no better at preventing severe blood loss. Syntometrine is associated with more side effects including nausea, vomiting, and high blood pressure, and has been linked with rare, but fatal, cases of stroke. All guidelines therefore recommend Syntocinon for preventing PPH.Following a telephone survey of all maternity units in the UK, 71.4% of units still routinely use Syntometrine.~Carbetocin is a newer medicine, already widely used after caesarean section, but not yet after vaginal birth. Other studies have shown that Carbetocin is slightly better at preventing bleeding after birth when compared to Syntometrine, has fewer side effects than Syntometrine, and that it may be just as good as Syntocinon at preventing PPH. No studies have directly compared all three medicines or compared their overall cost; information vital to the NHS.~Investigators propose a trial of 5712 women over 13 months, in four maternity units to compare the effectiveness, side effects and cost of Syntocinon, Syntometrine and Carbetocin, for women having a vaginal birth.~Women will be randomly allocated to receive one of these drugs. Women and staff will not know which drug they receive. Staff will collect data such as the number of extra drugs and treatments needed and the volume of blood lost. Women will be asked to complete a side effects questionnaire.

Epidemiologists have observed that people who live in countries where people on average eat a diet high in fish have a lower risk of depression than people who live in populations that eat less fish. Postpartum depression is also less common in these countries. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are thought to be responsible for this beneficial effect of eating fish. The two major omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is an essential building block of the brain and nerve tissue. EPA may act to optimize the electrical signals between nerve cells and brain cells and may help the immune system to function well.~Some researchers have treated people who are already suffering from depression with fish oil. Some of these studies have shown a benefit for the fish oil treatment and others have not. These studies have tested EPA and DHA alone and in various combinations.

In addition, we hope to better evaluate the impact of cumulative dose of fentanyl on breastfeeding success in the initial postpartum period as well as at 6 weeks and 6 months post delivery. In order to better assess the quality of breastfeeding, we will utilize a validated breastfeeding assessment tool, LATCH (Latch, Audible swallowing, Type of Nipple, Comfort, and Help). This validated tool can assess maternal and infant variables, define areas of needed intervention, and determine priorities in providing patient teaching. The LATCH assessment has been shown to be a predictor of breastfeeding duration. We also plan to vary the dosage of fentanyl analgesia to determine the relationship between doses below 150 micrograms and changes in breastfeeding assessments. If a clear association between decreased breastfeeding and total fentanyl is identified, then regimens to reduce cumulative doses of fentanyl can be developed to improve the likelihood of breastfeeding success in mothers that desire to breastfeed.~Prior observational studies have inferred epidurals negatively affect breastfeeding by decreasing maternal plasma oxytocin release which may adversely affect infant neurobehavioral development. In a study by Beilin et al., it was reported that mothers receiving a high cumulative dose (> 150 microgram) epidural fentanyl were more likely to have stopped nursing 6 weeks postpartum compared with groups receiving no fentanyl or those receiving < 150 microgram. The study however, was underpowered to detect differences in breastfeeding prior to hospital discharge.

"95","NCT00344058","Abbreviated Post-partum Magnesium Sulfate Seizure Prophylaxis in Preeclampsia: A Comparison of 12 and 24 Hour Regimens","Magnesium sulfate is used for seizure prophylaxis in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. There is debate as to how long to continue this therapy after delivery of the pregnancy. Different schemes have been offered to shorten the exposure to magnesium sulfate after delivery, with little data. We seek to investigate the effect of shortened magnesium sulfate therapy on the post-partum recovery phase of mild preeclampsia. Our hypothesis was that shortened therapy (12 hours versus the traditional 24 hours post-partum) has no effect on disease course, and will result in significantly shorter exposure to magnesium sulfate.","Inclusion Criteria:~Women with suspected mild preeclampsia diagnosed antepartum, intrapartum, or post-partum were eligible for inclusion after delivery at term (≥ 34 weeks' gestational age).~Exclusion Criteria:~Inability to give informed consent, preterm delivery, severe preeclampsia","Postpartum intervention","We seek to investigate the effect of shortened magnesium sulfate therapy on the post-partum recovery phase of mild preeclampsia.",1,1,"We seek to investigate the effect of shortened magnesium sulfate therapy on the post-partum recovery phase of mild preeclampsia."
