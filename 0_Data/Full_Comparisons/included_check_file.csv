"2","NCT01668069","Is Zofran Superior to Pyridoxine at Reducing Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy","Our purpose is to determine whether ondansetron, a commonly used antiemetic, is equivalent in efficacy to the combination of pyridoxine and doxylamine, the currently recommended first line therapy for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Since both treatments are safe in pregnancy, many physicians are using ondansetron as first line in practice. Despite this practice and the recommendations from ACOG, there is not data to suggest that ether practice is superior. This will be the first prospective, randomized, double blind, controlled trial comparing the two treatments. We hypothesize that ondansetron will be equally efficacious in reducing nausea and episodes of emesis.

Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with Sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP), the administration of SP at predefined intervals in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy irrespective of the presence of malaria parasitemia, is currently recommended for HIV-negative women in all areas with stable moderate to high transmission of malaria. Due to increasing resistance to SP, it is no longer used as a treatment for symptomatic malaria, and the efficacy of IPTp-SP seems to be decreased. This study aims to look at a new drug, Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) for IPTp, as well as to explore the strategy of intermittent screening and treatment in pregnancy (ISTp) with DP. This strategy uses increased screening at time of focused antenatal care (FANC) with treatment of women who screen positive.~The hypothesis is that the efficacy of both IPTp-DP and ISTp-DP will be associated with a reduction in malaria infection at delivery among HIV(-) women when compared to IPTp-SP, in an area with decreasing malaria transmission and high levels of SP resistance in Kenya.","Female","N/A","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Viable pregnancy assessed by Doppler~Gestational age 16 to 32 weeks (inclusive) by fundal height~No history of IPTp use during this pregnancy~Willing to participate and complete the study schedule~Willing to sign or thumb print informed consent~Resident of study area and intending to stay in the area for the duration of the follow-up~Willing to deliver in the labor ward of the study clinic or hospital~HIV negative at enrolment~Exclusion Criteria:~HIV positive or unknown~Residence outside study area or planning to move out in the 12 months following enrolment~High risk pregnancy, including any pre-existing illness likely to cause complication of pregnancy (hypertension, diabetes, asthma, epilepsy, renal disease, liver disease, fistula repair, leg or spine deformity)~Severe anemia requiring blood transfusion (Hb ≤ 7.0 g/dL) at enrolment~Known allergy or previous adverse reaction to any of the study drugs~Unable to give informed consent (for example due to mental disability)~Previous inclusion in the same study~Gestational age >32 weeks~Previous IPTp during the current pregnancy~Participating in other malaria intervention studies~Known or suspected cardiac disease~Patients taking drugs in any of the following classes: antiarrhythmic agents, neuroleptics, macrolides, and certain antimalarial drugs such as mefloquine, chloroquine, halofantrine and lumefantrine.","Included","The trial explicitly includes pregnant women as it aims to study the efficacy of malaria treatment during pregnancy.

"4","NCT03029702","Metabolic Analysis for Treatment Choice in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus","Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a significant clinical and public health burden, affecting over 400,000 pregnant women in the United States each year. Without adequate treatment, women with GDM and their infants are at risk for substantial morbidity. Because of this, experts recommend treatment focused on normalization of hyperglycemia to improve outcomes. However, providers have limited capacity to predict which treatment will achieve glycemic goals. This results in a choice based on provider and patient preference and a trial and error approach, which can create delays in glycemic control within the short (8-10 weeks) window between diagnosis and delivery. Maternal and fetal morbidity may be related to a mismatch between glycemic pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of glucose-lowering agents. In fact, GDM is heterogeneous, with predominant insulin resistance (IR) in 50%, insulin secretion deficit (ISD) in 30%, and a combination of both in 20% of women as underlying mechanisms of hyperglycemia. This variation in GDM pathophysiology and clinical outcomes supports the use of an individualized treatment approach. The overall goal of this project is to investigate an individualized treatment approach for GDM where treatment is based on each woman's GDM mechanism. The study will employ the same treatment in both arms, but choice of treatment will differ based on study arm (matched or unmatched to GDM mechanism).","Female","18 Years","45 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant women beyond 24 weeks of gestation who are scheduled for a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test.~Exclusion Criteria:~Fetal anomaly~Pregestational diabetes~GDM diagnosis without a 3-hour OGTT~Multifetal gestation~Treatment with non-inhaled steroids within 7 days~Allergy to glyburide, metformin or sulfa~History of severe pulmonary (pulmonary requirement for oxygen therapy or daily treatment for restrictive of obstructive pulmonary disease)~Hepatic (LFT's greater than two times of upper normal range)~Renal (serum creatinine higher than 1.2 mg/dL) disease~History of heart failure or myocardial infarction","Included","The study explicitly includes pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) beyond 24 weeks of gestation.

"16","NCT01192035","PI or NNRTI as First-line Treatment of HIV in a West African Population With Low Adherence - the PIONA Trial","BACKGROUND: Since 1996 the combination of three or more drugs has been the mainstay of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. The most important types of drugs are called nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) Response to treatment is measured as increasing CD4+ cell count and decreasing HIV viral load. A major problem is the development of resistance. NNRTIs are recommended as part of first-line treatment of HIV in Africa but many Africans have a slower NNRTI clearance than Caucasians making them more susceptible for development of resistance in case of treatment interruptions. PIs might therefore be a better option in an African setting with low adherence.~AIM: To evaluate two different treatment regimens in HIV-1 infected patients:~A) A NNRTI (efavirenz/nevirapine) based regimen and B) A PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir) based regimen with regard to treatment outcomes. HYPOTHESIS: Treatment with a PI will be superior to treatment with a NNRTI due to less development of resistance.~METHODS: Treatment-naïve adult HIV-1 patients enrolled in an existing cohort The West African Retrovirus and Acquired Immune Deficiency (WARAID) cohort in Guinea Bissau with CD4+ cell count ≤ 350 cells/µL and/or clinical signs of immune suppression (World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage 3 or 4) will be randomised 1:1 to: Treatment A: 2 NRTIs (lamivudine and either zidovudine or stavudine) and 1 NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine) or Treatment B: 2 NRTIs (same as in treatment A) and 1 PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir). Primary outcome: Viral load suppression <400 copies/ml 12 months after enrolment.~PERSPECTIVES: Guidelines for treatment of HIV in Africa are more or less a copy of the guidelines used in Europe and North America. Genetic differences in pharmacokinetics, more women infected in Africa and difficulties ensuring good adherence mean that results obtained from Caucasian patients are not directly transferrable to African patients. The results of this study will hopefully help guiding the treatment of HIV in Africa in the future. The investigators believe the HIV infected people in West Africa deserve the same evidence-based medicine as in developed countries.","All","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Antiretroviral treatment (ART) naïve HIV-1 infected patients.

Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, is a widely accepted induction agent, that has been proven safe and effective for induction of labor. It stimulates both cervical ripening and uterine contractions, thus making it an ideal induction agent for unfavorable cervices. Research has examined the pharmacokinetics of different administration routes and effects on uterine contractility, side effects, and safety. Vaginal misoprostol has been shown to be superior over oral administration however patients often prefer a more tolerable route. Buccal administration has already been shown to be as effective as vaginal misoprostol for cervical ripening and induction in both first trimester and second trimester abortions. There is minimal research comparing buccal versus vaginal for third trimester induction of labor. The investigators study is a prospective, double blinded, randomized control trial comparing vaginal misoprostol and buccal misoprostol in equal dosages of 25 mcg.

Due to variations in the standard of care for HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women and their infants at different sites, not all of these questions were relevant. Therefore, two separate versions of the PROMISE protocol were developed, each containing only the relevant components. The 1077BF protocol was used at sites where the standard method of infant feeding was breastfeeding, whereas the 1077FF protocol was used at sites where the standard method of infant feeding was formula feeding.

Cotrimoxazole (CTM), actually administered daily as a prophylactic mean to opportunistic infections for HIV infected patients, showed encouraging results in preventing malaria in pregnant women. However, these results must be confirmed by randomized trials, particularly in pregnant women.~The main objective of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of cotrimoxazole (CTM), administered once daily with IPT-SP (3 curative doses spaced one month) on placental parasitaemia in pregnant women infected with HIV and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) > 350 cells/mm3.~The main hypothesis is based on the premise that cotrimoxazole is more effective than IPT-SP for placental parasitaemia. This might be due to the higher plasma concentration of cotrimoxazole attained with daily doses. If this hypothesis is proven, cotrimoxazole could be recommended as prophylaxis for HIV-positive pregnant women, whatever their CD4+ cell count.

They are also more common in obese women. Cesarean sections are the most common surgery performed in the United States, therefore pregnant women are being faced with this problem frequently. There is evidence to show that prophylactically administered antibiotics, cefazolin specifically, to obese women prior to cesarean section do not reach adequate concentrations in adipose tissue to prevent infection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if an increased dose of cefazolin will attain adequate tissue concentration in obese women. Our hypothesis is that three grams of cefazolin given no more than 60 minutes prior to the start of a cesarean section in an obese (Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30) woman will attain adequate adipose tissue concentration compared to two grams of cefazolin.~Subjects will be selected if they are greater than 37 weeks gestation wiht a singleton pregnancy and require a cesarean section for any obstetrical indication.

Once enrolled the subjects will be randomized to receive either two grams or three grams of cefazolin as prophylactic antibiotics to be given no more than 60 minutes prior to the start of the surgery.~Two adipose tissue samples will be obtained at the time of surgery. The first at the start after skin incision and the second at the end prior to closure of the skin. There will also be a separate IV placed at the start of the procedure from which three blood draws can be collected.

"38","NCT01904500","Peri-operative Cefazolin Prophylaxis at Time of Cesarean Delivery in the Obese Gravida","Obesity has become an increasingly prevalent public health problem in the United States, reaching epidemic proportions. According to 2009 CDC epidemiologic data on obesity in the United States, 35.7% of the United States population is considered overweight or obese. Currently, on the review of the literature, over 20% of pregnancies in this country are complicated by maternal obesity. Obesity has been well demonstrated to be correlated with numerous adverse pregnancy outcomes such hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and increased rates of operative delivery. Moreover, obesity, irrespective of pregnancy, has been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for the development of postoperative surgical site infections. Development of such infections can have both consequential long-term medical sequelae for patients and economic impacts on the health care system at large. Cefazolin, a first generation hydrophilic cephalosporin whose clearance is exclusively mediated via the kidneys unchanged, is used as pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis for cesarean deliveries. The current accepted standard of care is to administer 2 grams of cefazolin within 60 minutes of skin incision. Studies of drug concentrations of cephalosporins for pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis in obese bariatric patients have shown that therapeutic concentrations may not be achieved in both tissue and plasma. Limited data exist in pregnancy. Therefore, it is the goal of this study to investigate whether obese patients presenting for cesarean delivery require an increased dosing amount of pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. This study will randomized women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or more who are presenting for their scheduled cesarean delivery to receive either 2 grams or 3 grams of cefazolin for pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis.

The investigators found increased time to pregnancy (TTP) in women with asthma compared to non-asthmatic women (55 vs 33 months, p<0.001), furthermore, women with asthma had less successful pregnancies following fertility treatment (39.6 vs 60.4%, p=0.002). Treatment with omalizumab stabilizes the eosinophilic disease, through the systemic and most likely the anti-inflammatory pathways, which indicate a promising possibility to increase pregnancy rate. In a small real-life study in 2017, 5 patients with eosinophilic asthma who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF), were treated with omalizumab prior to embryo transplantation; three out of the five women became pregnant. Lastly, the two remaining patients had several treatments with omalizumab, but did not become pregnant. This real-life study calls for further investigation. By targeting systemic inflammation with omalizumab treatment the aim is to increase asthma control before and during pregnancy. A treatment strategy aiming at improving overall inflammatory control may increase fertility, but also reduce well known maternal and perinatal adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low-birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), preterm delivery.~Study design:~A randomized control trial with omalizumab and placebo, stratified for blood eosinophil count, is therefore needed. A randomized, double blinded, parallel group, study to evaluate the difference between omalizumab (O) and placebo (P) on pregnancy rate in patients with atopic asthma.Treatment schedule: After collection of material (blood samples, sputum) 6th day (±1 day) of the menstrual cycle, the patients will be randomized in either the omalizumab group or the placebo group. No collection of material will be done at the time of enrollment, as this will be on different time of the female cycles.

If no pregnancy has occurred after first IVF cycle, this will be repeated for 3 consecutive IVF cycles in total or until pregnancy has occurred.~Outcome:~The primary out-come is efficacy of omalizumab, compared to placebo, in increasing pregnancy rate in females with asthma.

"49","NCT03423147","A Randomized Trial to Determine if a Pre-operative Wash With a Chlorhexidine Gluconate Cloth and Chlorhexidine Gluconate Vaginal Scrub Reduces Infectious Morbidity in Patients Undergoing Cesarean Section After Labor","Surgical site infections (SSI) are the second most common cause of nosocomial infections accounting for 15% of all nosocomial infections among hospitalized patients and 38% of nosocomial infections in surgical patients. In obstetric patients, infectious morbidity (i.e. SSI, endometritis) occurs in 5-10% of cesarean sections, which is 5-fold higher than vaginal deliveries. Additionally, infectious morbidity is thought to be highest in those patients who have cesarean sections after undergoing labor.~Chlorhexidine, a chemical antiseptic effective on gram positive and gram negative bacteria, reduces skin microflora/colonization but it is not clear if it decreases the risk of SSI.~Historically, chlorhexidine has been studied and used in orthopedic and cardiac implant surgeries. Research on the use of chlorhexidine for SSI prevention in cesarean sections is limited. This study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of use of both chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) wipe and vaginal scrub in reducing SSI in patients undergoing cesarean section that have previously been laboring. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: wash with both a pre-operative CHG cloth prior to surgery and chlorhexidine gluconate vaginal scrub in addition to standard preoperative scrub as compared to standard preoperative scrub alone.","Female","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Women at > 24 weeks gestation who are admitted in labor or admitted for induction of labor at Mount Sinai Hospital~Exclusion Criteria:~Allergy to chlorhexidine~Unplanned or emergency cesarean section~Women at <24 weeks gestation~Estimated fetal weight <500 grams~Fetal face presentation regardless of gestational age.","Included","The trial explicitly includes pregnant women at > 24 weeks gestation who are admitted in labor or admitted for induction of labor.

"50","NCT00811057","Tocolysis for Preterm Labor","Preterm birth is the most common and costly complication in obstetrics. It complicates up to 11% of all pregnancies and it is responsible for 70% of sick babies. The ideal way to stop preterm labor when it occurs (which drug to use) is not known. Currently magnesium sulfate is used by about 95% of all practitioners, but recent data suggest magnesium given this way may be harmful for the baby's future development. Other drugs such as antiprostaglandin agents are very effective in stopping uterine activity, but particularly when used for >48 hours have been associated with both maternal and fetal sides effects. Lastly, calcium channel antagonists are effective in stopping contractions and have very little in the way of maternal and fetal side effects, but less data is available in the United States on their use. Because there is no FDA approved drug to stop preterm labor, we purpose to randomize all women with preterm labor (20-34 weeks) to receive one of the above three methods of stopping preterm labor. The primary outcomes will be to see which agent stops the uterine contractions most effectively, for the longest period of time with fewest relapses and results in significant prolongation of pregnancy. If one of these agents is clearly superior to the other two it would help women avoid early delivery or have significant extension of their pregnancy to avoid some of the complications of preterm birth in the baby.","Female","16 Years","45 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnancies with intact membranes in confirmed preterm labor;~20 - 32 weeks' gestation;~Cervical dilatation 0 - 3cm versus 4 - 6cm;~No conditions contraindicating continued pregnancy (severe IUGR, chorioamnionitis, non-reassuring fetal tracing - physician judgement); AND~Able and willing to consent to the study protocol.~Exclusion Criteria:~Failure to meet admission criteria;~Known serious fetal malformations;~Severe maternal/obstetric disease affecting the mother or fetus (severe cardiac disease, placental abruption/previa, severe diabetes, severe preeclampsia, etc. - physician judgment);~Allergic to magnesium, antiprostaglandin or calcium channel antagonist;~Refusal or inability to consent to the study","Included","The study explicitly includes pregnant women in preterm labor (20-34 weeks) and aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different tocolytic agents in prolonging pregnancy.","Pregnancies with intact membranes in confirmed preterm labor; 20 - 32 weeks' gestation;",1,0,"0","1.

Aspirin (ASA) is currently the only prophylactic therapy for preeclampsia in high-risk women to be recognized by the US Preventive Task Force and should be initiated early in the second trimester of pregnancy, before 16 weeks of gestation. However, currently there is no literature comparing various low-dose ASA formulations in the risk reduction of PE. In the United States, the currently available low-dose ASA is over the counter and is found in 81mg tablets. Therefore, when clinicians initiate therapy with low dose ASA, they may prescribe 1 or 2 tablets of 81mg aspirin per day depending on personal preference and cannot be assisted by evidence to guide their decision.This study aims to determine the incidence of preterm PE or PE with severe features in women taking either 81mg or 162mg in a randomized setting, from a single center. The investigators hypothesize that the information gained from this trial will permit a more accurate sample size calculation for a larger clinical trial powered to accept or reject our testing hypothesis. If our hypothesis is rejected and 162mg of daily ASA is not associated with a lower incidence of severe or preterm PE compared to 81mg, this may be due to lack of power to detect a smaller effect.

"71","NCT04783051","Comparison of IST Using Ultra-sensitive Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test and Pyronaridine - Artesunate - PYRAMAX®) to Standard IPT Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to Prevent Malaria in Pregnant Women Living in Endemic Areas","In endemic settings Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) can sequester in the placenta resulting in low peripheral parasitemia and false negative malaria diagnosis in pregnant women. Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnant women with Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is one of the World Health Organization's recommended malaria control strategies in sub-Saharan African countries. The strategy overcomes the risk of misdiagnosis of malaria in pregnant women by treating them all with SP according to predetermined schedules, but the strategy is now threatened by the spread of Plasmodium parasite resistant strains. As a necessary alternative, Intermittent Screening and Treatment in pregnancy (ISTp), aims on the monthly screening of pregnant women with a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and the treatment of positive cases with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) regardless of the presence of symptoms. The ISTp depends on the performance of the diagnostic tests, and the use of ultrasensitive RDTs (us-RDTs), which have a higher analytical sensitivity than conventional RDTs, should improve the efficacy of the strategy.~Unlike IPTp-SP, ISTp prevents overuse of antimalarials and thus limits drug pressure on malaria parasites. This advantage could be potentiated by using, for pregnant women, an ACT that is not yet used or should not be used in the field for other strata of the population. The recently approved new ACT combination, Pyronaridine - Artesunate (Pyramax®) is the ideal candidate for this purpose.~This study will compare the effects of the ISTp using an us-RDT and Pyramax® (ISTp-US-Py) with the standard IPTp-SP on maternal malaria indicators (malaria infection, parasite density), maternal anemia, spontaneous abortions or intrauterine deaths during pregnancy, fetal morbidity (preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age) and neonatal mortality at delivery in both study groups through conducting a randomized clinical trial enrolling second trimester pregnant women in Maternité Esengo Health Center, located in Kisenso, Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a malaria perennial transmission area.~The results generated from this study will be essential for the National Malaria Control Program in the selection and implementation of new malaria control policies and addresses the effectiveness of IPTp-SP decline among pregnant women in the DRC.","Female","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Gestation ≥16 weeks;~Age: ≥18 years;~Residence within the health facility catchment area;~Willing to adhere to study requirements and to deliver at the health facility.~Willing to provide written informed consent; if the woman is illiterate, she can choose an impartial witness, not related to the study, to accompany her during the informant consent process and they will both sign the informed consent form~Exclusion Criteria:~Known history of allergy to SP or to an ACT~An ongoing antibioprophylaxis with cotrimoxazole,~Current issue requiring hospital admission (including severe malaria as defined by WHO)~Pregnancy at high risk","Included","The trial explicitly includes pregnant women in the second trimester and aims to compare malaria treatment strategies in this population.","This study will compare the effects of the ISTp using an us-RDT and Pyramax® (ISTp-US-Py) with the standard IPTp-SP on maternal malaria indicators... through conducting a randomized clinical trial enrolling second trimester pregnant women.",1,0,"0","5.

"72","NCT03893630","Role of Aspirin in Maternal Endothelial Dysfunction and Uterine Artery Blood Flow in Women at Risk for Preeclampsia","Endothelial dysfunction and defective placental vascularization are hypothesized to be significant causes of preeclampsia. In preeclampsia, due to vascular endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction and platelet activation can result in severe features which alter pregnancy outcomes. However, studies have shown that acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) can decrease endothelial dysfunction leading to decreased platelet aggregation which reduces adverse outcomes. The objective of our study is to determine if Aspirin has a dose-dependent response for modifying biomarkers reflective of maternal endothelial dysfunction when indicated for preeclampsia prevention in a cohort of women identified at risk for developing preeclampsia.~Pregnant women who are at risk for preeclampsia will be randomized to receive either 81mg Aspirin or 162mg Aspirin daily starting from 11-16 weeks of gestation until 36 weeks of gestation.

"76","NCT03553576","The Relationship Between Local Anesthetic Concentration and Volume on Adequate Labor Analgesia With Programmed Intermittent Epidural Bolus","Neuraxial labor analgesia is performed by the administration of a local anesthetic/opioid mixture in the epidural space. The delivery method is a combination of continuous infusion, provider-administered boluses and patient-administered boluses (patient controlled epidural analgesia [PCEA]) via epidural catheter. Pain during the first stage of labor is primarily due to lower uterine segment and cervical stretching. The pain signals enter the spinal cord through sensory nerves at the T10 through L1 dermatomes. Pain signals from the late first state and second stage of labor also arise from the vagina and perineum. These signals travel with the pudendal nerve and enter the spinal cord at S2-S4. Thus, the anesthetic solution administered through the lumbar epidural catheter must spread cephalad in the epidural space to reach the T10 nerve roots and spinal cord, and must spread caudad to reach the caudal nerve roots in the epidural space.~The optimal method for maintaining labor analgesia is unknown. Several studies have demonstrated that PIEB, in combination with PCEA, provide superior maintenance of labor analgesia (less need and longer time to provider intervention, lower local anesthetic consumption, less motor block, and improved patient satisfaction scores) than maintenance with a continuous infusion with PCEA.The mechanism for this difference is not known; however, one suggested mechanism is improved spread of the local anesthetic within the epidural space. Kaynar et al. injected methylene blue dye through a multi-orifice catheter using either a continuous infusion or intermittent bolus and the area of diffusion was measured on a piece of paper. The authors found that intermittent boluses were associated with a greater surface area of diffusion than continuous infusion. In a cadaver study, dye was injected into the lumbar epidural space, and cryomicrotome sections were taken.Dye flowed in rivulets through small channels in the epidural space, as opposed to moving as a unified front. The authors found dye injected at high pressures had more uniform spread through the epidural space, supporting the concept of intermittent epidural injection providing superior analgesia.~Epidural infusion pumps capable of delivering PIEB of local anesthetic with PCEA have become commercially available and many studies have attempted to assess the optimal parameter settings (including volume of programmed bolus, bolus interval, rate of bolus administration) to provide superior labor analgesia. Recently we completed a double-blinded randomized control trial evaluating two bolus delivery rates, hypothesizing that those patients randomized to receive higher bolus delivery rates would have improved labor analgesia. However, no difference was found between groups.What is more, both groups had a mean cephalad sensory level to cold of T6. This sensory level is higher than the traditional goal of T10 (upper dermatome level of uterine innervation), but despite the adequate sensory level, a large number of patients required supplemental physician-delivered boluses of local anesthetic during labor. Forty percent of the women in the high-rate group and 36% of the low-rate group required a manual re-dose during labor. This suggests that either a higher volume, or higher concentration of local anesthetic (i.e., higher dose) is needed to maintain adequate labor analgesia.~Traditionally higher concentration local anesthetic solutions have been associated with increased motor blockade leading to a higher incidence of instrumental vaginal delivery. Several local anesthetic solutions with varying drug concentrations are available for labor analgesia and are used clinically in the United States. We plan to perform a randomized, controlled, double-blind study to test the hypothesis that patients whose labor analgesia is maintained using PIEB with low-volume bolus (6.25 mL) of a higher local anesthetic concentration solution (0.1% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL) will require less supplemental analgesia (manual provider re-doses) than patients whose PIEB is delivered with a high-volume bolus (10 mL) of lower density local anesthetic solution (0.0625% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL).~The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between bolus volume and concentration of local anesthetic during maintenance of labor analgesia with programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB) analgesia.~The hypothesis of this study is: patients whose labor analgesia is maintained using PIEB with low-volume bolus (6.25 mL) of higher local anesthetic concentration solution (0.1% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL) will have a longer duration of adequate analgesia (time to first manual re-dose request) than patients whose PIEB is delivered with a high-volume bolus (10 mL) of lower concentration local anesthetic solution (0.0625% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL).","Female","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~18 years and above~Nulliparous parturients~Present to the labor and delivery unit for an induction of labor or who are in spontaneous labor~Request neuraxial labor analgesia at ≤5 cm cervical dilation~Exclusion Criteria:~Patients who are not eligible to receive a combined spinal epidural (CSE) technique with 25 mcg of intrathecal fentanyl~Non-English speaking~Failed initiation of CSE analgesia (VAS pain score >10 15 minutes after intrathecal dose)~Need to have the epidural catheter replaced during labor~Who deliver within 90 minutes of initiation of labor analgesia~Require re-dose within 90 minutes of initiation of labor analgesia.","Included","The study explicitly includes pregnant individuals as it focuses on labor analgesia for women in labor.","Present to the labor and delivery unit for an induction of labor or who are in spontaneous labor",1,0,"0","16.

"129","NCT04158713","Chemoprevention With Monthly IPTp With Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for Malaria in HIV-infected Pregnant Participants on Daily Cotrimoxazole in Kenya and Malawi: a Multi-centre Placebo-controlled Trial","2.3.3 Short technical protocol summary Background: Pregnant women represent a vulnerable population for malaria. HIV-infected women are particularly at risk. In HIV-infected pregnant women, WHO recommends daily cotrimoxazole (CTX), an antifolate drug, for malaria chemoprevention and prophylaxis against opportunistic infection. However, there is cross-resistance with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and high levels of antifolate resistance threatens the antimalarial effect of CTX. Recent trials with intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) with mefloquine in HIV-infected women on daily CTX, suggested that chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial markedly improves the protection against malaria compared to daily CTX alone. However, mefloquine was not well tolerated.~The long-acting combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is well tolerated and has shown great promise as IPTp in HIV-negative women in East-Africa. Chemoprevention with monthly DP has also been explored in HIV-infected pregnant women on daily CTX in Uganda. Unfortunately, the study was inconclusive because malaria transmission was too low and a clinically relevant drug interaction with efavirenz (EFV) was found reducing the exposure to DP. WHO now recommends dolutegravir (DTG) based combination antiretroviral therapy (ARTs) as the preferred firstline regimen including for pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. As a result, many countries in Africa are now transitioning to DTG-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cARTs). No such drug-drug interaction is expected between DTG and DP. We will, therefore, assess the safety and efficacy of malaria chemoprevention with monthly DP in HIV-infected women on daily CTX and DTG-based cARTs.~Objectives and methods: This is a 2-arm, individually-randomized, multi-centre, placebo-controlled superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of daily CTX plus monthly DP ('CTX-DP') versus daily CTX plus monthly placebo-DP (i.e. 'CTX-alone', control arm) to reduce malaria and the adverse effects of malaria in 898 (449 per arm) HIV-infected pregnant women on DTG-based cARTs. The study will be conducted in 8 hospitals in Kenya and Malawi in high SP-resistance areas with a high prevalence of malaria. These are the same sites where the sister trial in HIV-uninfected women is being conducted in Kenya and Malawi (IMPROVE trial). Both the mother and baby will be followed for 6-8 weeks after delivery. The study is powered at 80% (alpha=0.05) to detect ≥50% relative risk reduction (RR=0.50) in the primary outcome (cumulative incidence of malaria infection) from 12% in the CTX-alone arm (control arm) to 6% in in the interventions arm allowing for 20% non-contributors.

Bupivacaine is currently the standard spinal medication for these procedures because of its long history of safe use, its low incidence of transient neurologic symptoms, and its ability to provide a dependable, dense block with a high degree of maternal satisfaction. While bupivacaine has the aforementioned advantages, it unfortunately has a long duration of action, up to 240-380 minutes, which far exceeds the time necessary to complete most obstetric procedures. Clorotekal®, the first Food and Drug Administration approved chloroprocaine solution created for spinal injection, is a potential alternative. When compared with bupivacaine spinals, chloroprocaine spinals have been shown to facilitate clinically significant shorter times to resolution of motor and sensory block, first ambulation, micturition, and discharge readiness.

To meet objective 1, the investigators will collect quantitative data on participants' acceptability, health beliefs, barriers, and vaccination intentions using the health belief model (HBM) from patients meeting criteria for high-risk populations attending two public tertiary-level hospitals. To meet objective 2, in one of the two hospitals, the investigators will run an influenza vaccination campaign before the influenza season (the vaccines will be in the southern hemisphere), where the vaccine will be offered free of cost to high-risk patients, and in the second hospital, vaccination will not be offered. Both the vaccinated and unvaccinated participants will then be followed-up for one year period once a month to record any influenza-like illness, hospitalization, and death. Additional data for objective two on direct and indirect costs associated with influenza illness will be collected from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) at one public and one private hospital.

"143","NCT01513447","Intracutaneous Sterile Water Injection as an Adjunct to Neuraxial Labor Analgesia: A Randomized Controlled Trial","For most women, the most significant pain they will experience is the pain associated with childbirth. Up to one-third of women experience back labor, this typically occurs when the fetus assumes varying degrees of malposition, especially the occiput posterior position, and causes additional constant pressure against the maternal spine and pelvis. Back labor presents as constant pain, that occurs even between contractions. It is often difficult to manage, by the patient, the obstetrician, and the anesthesiologist, and may increase the rate of instrumental and caesarian delivery.~Epidural anesthesia/analgesia is the most common and effective intervention used to help women cope with labor pain. Dilute concentrations of local anesthetic and opioid provide complete analgesia for most women. Some women, however, have breakthrough pain, often due to back labor, and require more concentrated drug solutions. This increases the side effects associated with these drugs (e.g., hypotension, pruritus, motor block), thus treatment of this pain poses a challenge for the anesthesiologist and the obstetrician.~Sterile water injections (SWI) are a simple and well-established method of managing labor pain among midwives. This intervention was first used to alleviate pain associated with kidney stones, and was introduced to obstetrics in the 1970s. Using a syringe, small amounts of sterile water is deposited subcutaneously near the sacral area. The sterile water causes osmotic and mechanical irritation resulting in a brief (15-30 second) and significant stinging sensation. The onset of pain relief follows almost immediately and may last for up to two hours. The procedure can be repeated a number of times.~Sterile water for pain management is most often administered using four intracutaneous injections: two sites lateral to the lumbosacral spine and two sites 2-3 cm below and 1-2 cm medial to the original two injection sites. 0.1 mL of sterile water is injected between the dermal layers to raise a small bleb on the skin surface at each of the four sites. In labor, the injections are administered sequentially during a uterine contraction, with the series of four injections, performed two at a time, completed within 20-30 seconds.~The investigators hypothesize that the use of sterile water injections in women with neuraxial analgesia with breakthrough pain will result in decreased local anesthetic requirements and increase patient satisfaction.","Female","18 Years","60 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~multiparous women~spontaneous labor~at least 18 years of age~presenting for vaginal delivery with cervical dilation of 4 centimeters or less~Exclusion Criteria:~nulliparous~less than 18 years old~contraindication to placement of neuraxial anesthetic~skin infection in area to be injected~medical therapies considered to result in tolerance to opioids~history of chronic pain (requiring regular medical follow-up with pain specialists)~recent use of opioid analgesics (within the year preceding pregnancy)","Included","The trial explicitly includes pregnant women in labor, as it studies pain management during childbirth.","The investigators hypothesize that the use of sterile water injections in women with neuraxial analgesia with breakthrough pain will result in decreased local anesthetic requirements and increase patient satisfaction.",1,0,"0","16.

"149","NCT01472549","Antiseptic Skin Preparation for Preventing Surgical Site Infection at Cesarean Delivery: a Randomized Comparative Effectiveness Trial","The investigators propose a randomized controlled clinical trial to determine the comparative effectiveness of chlorhexidine-alcohol and iodine-alcohol preoperative skin preparation for preventing surgical site infections at cesarean section. While estimates vary, surgical site infections complicate up to 5 - 10% of all cesarean sections and result in significant human suffering and excess health care costs. Interventions such as preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis reduce surgical site infections by 60%, but the rate of infection remains high. There is therefore a great need to identify and test other potential interventions to further reduce these infections.~The skin is a major source of pathogens that cause surgical site infection. Therefore, optimizing preoperative skin antisepsis has the potential to decrease postoperative surgical site infections. There is paucity of evidence to guide the choice of antiseptic for skin preparation at cesarean section. To date, only two underpowered trials have been published comparing two methods of preoperative skin preparation at cesarean section. A recent randomized trial in adults undergoing clean-contaminated mostly general surgical procedures demonstrated a 41% reduction in surgical site infection with the use of chlorhexidine-alcohol when compared to the more commonly used povidone-iodine. While it is plausible that findings from trials in other clean-contaminated surgical procedures may apply to cesarean sections, physiological changes in pregnancy, the peculiar dual microbial source for cesarean-related infections and the hormone-mediated immune-modulation in pregnancy make the validity of such extrapolation uncertain.~The study has the following specific aims:~Primary Aim: To test the hypothesis that preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation at cesarean section significantly reduces surgical site infections compared to iodine-alcohol.~Secondary Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation at cesarean section significantly reduces bacterial contamination at the surgical site compared to iodine-alcohol.~Secondary Aim 2: To determine clinical outcomes and medical costs associated with cesarean-related infections and quantify potential cost savings attributable to use of chlorhexidine-alcohol for preoperative skin preparation at cesarean section.","Female","N/A","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Women undergoing cesarean delivery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.~Exclusion Criteria:~Inability to obtain consent; allergy to chlorhexidine, alcohol, iodine, shellfish; and evidence of infection adjacent to operative site.","Included","The trial explicitly includes pregnant individuals as it involves women undergoing cesarean delivery.","Women undergoing cesarean delivery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.",1,0,"0","15.

Dilapan-S is a mechanical device, known as an osmotic cervical dilator, which provides an alternative to drugs or surgery. Thin rods of an absorbent material (no active drug present) are inserted into the neck of the womb (cervix) and, as they absorb fluid, they swell and mimic the natural process of 'ripening' (or preparing) the cervix. This initial process is important before contractions begin. Unlike drugs, Dilapan-S does not cause premature contractions that, when too frequent, may cause the baby to become distressed. The project will compare cervical ripening using Dilapan-S with the standard use prostaglandin drug. Women with a single pregnancy, who require induction of labour, and who are not considered high risk, will be invited to participate. Investigators hope to recruit 860 women from UK maternity units over 2 years. Participants will have an equal chance of being randomised to the drug, which is standard practice, or the cervical dilator. The speed in which labour commences, the mode of delivery and any side effects will be compared. Importantly, investigators shall also assess patient satisfaction and anxiety during the induction process, by asking participants to complete a short questionnaire about their experience before they go home after having their baby.

The microbiome refers to the thousands of bacteria and molds that live in and on our bodies. The microbiome plays an important role in our health. Differences in the microbiome can affect our immune system in ways that might make some people more likely to get allergies and asthma.~Early life events and exposures are very important for establishing the human microbiome. The newborn baby's microbiome changes very quickly during the first weeks and months of life. There is information that suggests C-section birth is associated with higher risk of certain diseases, including allergies and asthma. Some researchers think one reason for this is that passing through the mother's vaginal canal during birth exposes the baby to bacteria that promote healthy immune system development, something that C-section babies don't get. Transferring these potentially beneficial vaginal bacteria to C-section babies may help prevent some diseases later.","Female","18 Years","45 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant woman must be able to understand and provide informed consent;~Pregnant women with singleton pregnancies with a non-anomalous, appropriately-grown fetus; and~Atopic disease (asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis) or food allergy in a first-degree relative of the infant to-be-delivered (for exception, see exclusion criteria*).~Exclusion Criteria:~For C-Section Mothers:~In labor with evidence of cervical change prior to the scheduled C-section;~Rupture of the amniotic sac; or~Vaginal pH > 4.5 on the day of delivery.~For Vaginal Delivery Mothers:~- Use of induction agents for cervical ripening (cervical prostaglandin or Foley catheter).~For All Mothers and Their Infants:~Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent or comply with study protocol;~History of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis within the past year in the mother;~Express no intention to breastfeed;~History of diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes mellitus;~History of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (e.g., Crohn's Disease or ulcerative colitis);~Evidence of an active sexually transmitted infection (STI) (e.g., primary herpes or genital warts, or trichomonas), yeast infection, or vaginosis on the day of delivery;~Evidence of prior or current hepatitis B or C infection as demonstrated by the presence of the hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody positivity against the hepatitis B core antigen, or antibody positivity against the hepatitis C virus;~--Assessment for active hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection will be repeated for this study even if prior testing during the current pregnancy was negative;~Evidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (e.g., positive HIV serology or detectable viral load);~Positive Group B Streptococcus (GBS) test results by rectovaginal swab performed within 5 weeks of delivery, a prior infant with invasive GBS disease, or GBS bacteriuria at any point during pregnancy;~Evidence of N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection by testing performed within 5 weeks of delivery;~History of antibiotic administration during the third trimester of the current pregnancy;~Mothers with serious chronic conditions during pregnancy;~Mothers with complicated pregnancies including pre-eclampsia, chorioamnionitis, placenta previa, vasa previa, placental abruption, or active vaginal bleeding;~Maternal fever on the day of delivery (visit 0);~Infants with complications during delivery, such that the infant requires more than the standard neonatal resuscitation after delivery;~Infants delivered prior to 37 weeks of gestation;~Thick particulate meconium noted upon delivery of the infant;~Presence of a congenital abnormality in the infant for which study participation is not recommended;~Current, diagnosed mental illness or current, diagnosed or self-reported drug or alcohol abuse in the mother that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements;~Use of investigational drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy; or~Past or current medical problems or findings from physical examination or laboratory testing that are not listed above, which, in the opinion of the investigator may:~Pose additional risks from participation in the study,~Interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements, or~May impact the quality or interpretation of the data obtained from the study.","Included","The study explicitly includes pregnant women as participants, as indicated by the inclusion criteria which state that pregnant women must be able to understand and provide informed consent.","Pregnant woman must be able to understand and provide informed consent",1,0,"0","15.

"161","NCT04542148","Glycemic Control After Antenatal Corticosteroids in Women With Pregestational and Gestational Diabetes (Close the GAP)","There is a fundamental gap in understanding the maternal and neonatal effects of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration in women with threatened preterm birth (PTB) who have diabetes. Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM, and there is limited data among women with gestational diabetes. While ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS in women with diabetes. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with diabetes as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims will determine the optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform a larger, multicenter trial to improve neonatal outcomes among women with diabetes and threatened PTB.","All","N/A","50 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~Gestational or pregestational type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with daily insulin injection(s) or oral hypoglycemic agents such as metformin~Hospitalized for antenatal corticosteroid administration in anticipation of preterm birth~Gestational age 23 0/7 weeks - 36 5/7 weeks~Maternal age 18-50~Exclusion Criteria:~Planned delivery < 72 hours after 1st dose of antenatal corticosteroids~More than 16 hours after 1st dose of antenatal corticosteroids~Major fetal anomaly~Triplet or higher order multiple gestation","Included","The trial explicitly includes pregnant women with gestational or pregestational type 2 diabetes mellitus who are hospitalized for antenatal corticosteroid administration in anticipation of preterm birth.","Inclusion Criteria: Gestational or pregestational type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with daily insulin injection(s) or oral hypoglycemic agents such as metformin~Hospitalized for antenatal corticosteroid administration in anticipation of preterm birth",1,0,"0","10.

"168","NCT05098067","Trial of Capsaicin Cream as an Adjunctive Therapy for Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy: A Pilot Investigation","Between fifty and eighty percent of pregnant women experience nausea and vomiting in pregnancy making it one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum is an extreme form of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and results in evidence of acute starvation (i.e. large ketonuria), and weight loss (>5% of a woman's pre-pregnancy weight). Hyperemesis gravidarum is also surprisingly common. In fact, it is the second leading cause of preterm hospitalization during pregnancy, second only preterm labor. Hospitalization is often required because hyperemesis is frequently refractory to common anti-nausea medications. However, capsaicin cream, a potent TRPV1 agonist, commonly used to relieve muscular and neuropathic pain, may be able to reduce the symptoms of nausea and emesis in patients with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Smaller studies have demonstrated capsaicin to be both safe and effective when used to treat intraoperative nausea during cesarean delivery. To begin to address whether capsaicin cream could be used to reduce preterm admissions and shorten emergency room visits for hyperemesis, this study will randomize women presenting to the emergency room for nausea and vomiting to treatment with capsaicin cream as an adjunctive medication or routine care. The project will investigate the impact of capsaicin cream on hospital length of stay as well as representation for additional treatment. If effective, capsaicin cream has the potential not only to reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions and overall health care costs, but also to drastically improve patient quality of life.","Female","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant women in the first trimester (0-14 weeks gestation)~Presenting to the emergency room at Women & Infants Hospital in Rhode Island with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting~English or Spanish speaking~Have not taken an anti-emetic such as Reglan or Zofran within the 6 hours prior to presentation~Exclusion Criteria:~Allergy to Reglan, capsaicin or Zofran~Another identifiable source for nausea and vomiting (i.e. gastritis, COVID, diabetic ketoacidosis)~Molar pregnancies,~Patients with a history of gastroparesis~Patients with a history of preexisting diabetes mellitus","Included","The trial explicitly includes pregnant women in the first trimester presenting with nausea and vomiting, making it clear that pregnant individuals are included.","Inclusion Criteria: Pregnant women in the first trimester (0-14 weeks gestation)",1,0,"0","27.

"171","NCT01916681","Foley OR MisO for the Management of Induction (FOR MOMI) Trial","The percentage of women undergoing an induction of labor (IOL) is estimated to be 20% and continues to rise. Simultaneously, the cesarean delivery (CD) rate has continued to increase (2). Induction is a known risk factor for CD. Despite numerous studies evaluating time periods to define a failed IOL, there are no guidelines or accepted definitions of when to call an IOL failed given the incremental gain in vaginal delivery when IOL is prolonged. While decreasing the CD rate is an important primary focus in obstetrics, attention must also be paid to the overall length of labor given that prolonged labor is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, a prolonged labor is associated with an increase in direct hospital costs and healthcare utilization. The use of cervical ripening agents, such as vaginal prostaglandin and mechanical dilators, has been demonstrated to reduce labor time and CD rate. In addition to specific individual agents, certain dosing and regimens for IOL and active labor have been compared to evaluate whether a particular dose or regimen can decrease the length of labor and decrease the CD rate. Most of these regimens; however, focus on individual induction agents and few have compared the efficacy of using more than one agent simultaneously.

"183","NCT02314728","Cervical Ripening in Premature Rupture of Membranes","Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is diagnosed by demonstrating amniotic fluid in the vaginal canal before the onset of labor. The integrity of the amniotic membrane is compromised thereby increasing the risk of intrauterine infection and compression of the umbilical cord. PROM complicates 3% to 8% of pregnancies in the US and is responsible for 30% of preterm births. Intrauterine infection remains the most significant maternal and neonatal sequelae associated with PROM and this risk increases with the length of time from ruptured membrane to delivery. Induction of labor has been shown to reduce the rates of chorioamnionitis, endometritis and NICU admissions4. Specifically, induction of labor with prostaglandin agents followed by oxytocin, versus oxytocin alone has been shown to be effective for labor induction resulting in vaginal delivery. Management strategies for PROM have been controversial, and published studies on outcomes are over one to two decades old, which does not account for changes in clinical trends and practice patterns. Recently ACOG recommends that patients presenting at 37 weeks gestation or greater with PROM should be induced if not in labor, and generally with oxytocin. In women with PROM without the onset of labor, the cervix is commonly unfavorable and induction with oxytocin alone may lead to an increased risk of cesarean section. With a c-section rate as high as 33%, women undergoing induction of labor have an increased risk of c-section and its associated morbidity and long term sequela. ACOG's recommendation for the use of oxytocin as the induction agent may be meant to avoid a theoretical increased risk of chorioamnionitis in this patient population however it does not take into account the status of the cervix, which may result in a increased risk of c-section. The purpose of the proposed study is to determine whether cervical ripening in women with PROM and an unfavorable cervix is associated with increase rates of vaginal delivery and decreased cesarean section rate compared to induction of labor with oxytocin alone. The investigators aim to determine the incidence of endometritis, and neonatal infection associated with PROM in the current medical environment of antibiotic prophylaxis and antenatal steroid use, taking into account the changes in patient characteristics.","Female","15 Years","50 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~All pregnant women diagnosed with PROM without evidence of labor requiring induction~Gestational Age > 34 weeks~Bishop score < 6~Category I Fetal heart rate tracing~Exclusion Criteria:~Contraindication to Induction of Labor~Multiple gestation~Fetal Anomalies~Previous C-Section~HIV Positive Patients","Included","The study explicitly includes pregnant women diagnosed with PROM without evidence of labor requiring induction.","Inclusion Criteria: All pregnant women diagnosed with PROM without evidence of labor requiring induction",1,0,"0","16.

"199","NCT02528981","Effect of Probiotics on GBS Colonization Status During Pregnancy: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in Canada. It may be passed from a study participant colonized in the genital tract by GBS to their baby during vaginal birth. While approximately 10 to 30% of pregnant people harbour GBS in the vagina or rectum, the incidence of neonatal GBS disease is 1 to 2 infants per 1000 births. The use of intrapartum antibiotics to treat colonized individuals with or without risk factors has led to a 70% decline in the incidence of early-onset GBS sepsis in the past decade. Despite this impressive decline, antibiotic resistance has become a major public health concern. Association between intrapartum antibiotic use and ampicillin resistance in E. coli isolated from neonates has previously been documented. Furthermore, while GBS has remained sensitive to penicillin, 20% are resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, which are alternate drugs for patients allergic to penicillin. Alternative approaches are therefore needed to reduce the risk of GBS infection.~We therefore propose to study the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 (Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14) in the colonization status of GBS in pregnant people. Lactobacilli are part of normal gut and vaginal flora and have been widely used as probiotics to treat various conditions. In particular, these two strains have shown to be beneficial in the treatment of urinary tract infections and bacterial vaginosis. Our study design involves recruiting two hundred pregnant people (one hundred in each arm) through various midwifery practices in the GTA at the end of their first trimester of pregnancy. These individuals will be randomized to receive probiotics or placebo for twelve weeks of their pregnancies and will be cultured before delivery to determine their colonization status.

It complicates up to 11 % of all pregnancies and it is responsible for 70% of sick babies. Recently two studies have shown that giving progesterone (a normal hormone made by the ovaries) prolongs gestation in women who have had a preterm birth in an earlier pregnancy (and therefore are at risk for another early delivery). There are other studies that show that this technique of giving a weekly shot of progesterone does not prevent preterm birth. In addition, There are other groups of patients who are at very high risk for preterm birth which have not been studied. They include: 1.) Cervical cerclage (a stitch in the mouth of the womb); 2.) Multifetal gestation (twins, triplets, etc.); 3.) Women with preterm (<34 weeks) rupture of the membranes; 4.) Women with preterm labor during the current pregnancy with intact membranes who have been tocolyzed (have their labor stopped and are getting ready to go home). We purpose to give weekly shots of progesterone or a placebo in a randomized fashion to women in the first group who are at risk for preterm delivery due to an early birth in a previous pregnancy as well as the other four groups listed. If progesterone given weekly is successful at preventing early delivery as compared to the placebo group then great benefit for these women as well as future pregnancies would be accrued.","Female","16 Years","45 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnancy 20 - 34 weeks; cervical dilation <4 cm; risk for preterm birth; multifetal gestation; diagnosis of preterm labor during the current pregnancy effectively tocolyzed); preterm rupture of the fetal membranes (24 - 34 weeks); willing and able to sign Informed Consent Form~Exclusion Criteria:~Failure to meet inclusion criteria as noted above; contraindication to pregnancy continuation; severe medical diseases such as sickle cell disease with crises, diabetes mellitus (F/R/H), severe preeclampsia etc., (physician judgment; severe fetal/obstetric criteria such as intrauterine growth restriction (<5th percentile, placental abruption,placental previa, etc., (physician judgment); non reassuring fetal assessment; allergy to progesterone compounds; refusal to participate","Included","The trial explicitly includes pregnant individuals at risk for preterm birth due to various conditions such as multifetal gestation, preterm labor, and preterm rupture of membranes.","Inclusion Criteria: Pregnancy 20 - 34 weeks; cervical dilation <4 cm; risk for preterm birth; multifetal gestation; diagnosis of preterm labor during the current pregnancy effectively tocolyzed); preterm rupture of the fetal membranes (24 - 34 weeks); willing and able to sign Informed Consent Form",1,0,"0","1.

It has many important uses including treatment of hypocalcemia, treatment of magnesium toxicity, prevention of hypocalcemia during blood transfusion (of citrate containing blood products), treatment of hyperkalemia, and others. Recent clinical trials also suggest that calcium given after cord clamping may decrease blood loss in patients undergoing cesarean delivery. 2 FDA approved forms of calcium can be given intravenously: calcium chloride and calcium gluconate. Over the last decade there have been times with drug shortages of either calcium chloride or calcium gluconate. So there have been and likely will continue to be times when one formulation or the other may not be adequately available. Despite the importance of calcium and the frequency in which it is used in parturients, there are no published studies in parturients to determine dose equivalence between calcium gluconate and calcium chloride. In this study the investigators will determine the population pharmacokinetics of calcium gluconate and calcium chloride in parturients and calculate the dose equivalent ratio the two drugs. This will help clinicians select appropriate doses of calcium and provide resilience to the drug supply chain in our era of frequent drug shortages.","Female","18 Years","45 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant female subjects delivering at the study institution via scheduled cesarean delivery at term (>=37 weeks gestation)~Exclusion Criteria:~severe range blood pressure (BP >160/>110) within the 48 hours prior to delivery~patient age <18 years or >45 years~renal dysfunction with serum Cr > 1.0 mg/dL~known history of congenital or acquired cardiac disease or history of arrhythmia~patient taking digoxin~patient currently taking a calcium channel blocker~Weight <55kg or >100kg, or~receiving magnesium infusion within 24 hours prior to or during cesarean delivery~administration of intraoperative doses of calcium by the anesthesiology team for clinical indications","Included","The study explicitly includes pregnant individuals delivering via scheduled cesarean delivery at term (>=37 weeks gestation).","Pregnant female subjects delivering at the study institution via scheduled cesarean delivery at term (>=37 weeks gestation)",1,0,"0","28.

Patients will be admitted to the hospital for a 24-hour monitoring period. If the patient remains without further complications during this monitoring period, the patient will be eligible for enrollment. If enrollment is desired, the patient will be randomly assigned to receive either antibiotics (treatment arm of the study) or no antibiotics (control arm of the study). The treatment arm will receive an outpatient, 7-day course of oral antibiotics (azithromycin and amoxicillin) with the first dose given in the hospital to ensure no side effects. The control arm will not receive outpatient antibiotics. Both groups will have weekly, office follow-up visits with high-risk pregnancy specialists to ensure no further complications. Both groups will be admitted to the hospital if the patients reach 23 0/7 weeks without complications.

In a recent clinical trial (MOTHER), buprenorphine was associated with superior neonatal outcomes such as shorter duration of treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) compared to methadone. However, buprenorphine was also associated with greater study discontinuation (33% vs. 18%) and illicit opioid use (33% vs. 23%) compared to methadone. Treatment dropout often leads to relapse and resumption of high-risk behaviors, overshadowing any short-term improvement in neonatal outcomes. Therefore, The goal of this K23 proposal is to conduct a pilot study to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized comparative effectiveness clinical trial comparing office-based buprenorphine vs. federally licensed methadone programs for the treatment of OD pregnant women.~A pilot study is critical to develop the outcome measures, assessment tools and participant tracking techniques necessary for a future, large-scale comparative effectiveness clinical trial.

"240","NCT04417595","Investigating N-3 Fatty Acids to Prevent Neonatal Tobacco-related outcomeS","Smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth, neonatal death, and maternal complications. Rates of smoking cessation during pregnancy are low, particularly in underserved populations, and currently approved pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation either are considered unsafe in pregnancy or have uncertain effectiveness. Identifying safe and effective interventions, which might mitigate the adverse effects of smoking on maternal-fetal outcomes, is a major public health priority. We hypothesize that smoking-induced n-3 LCPUFA relative deficiencies may be an important mechanism contributing to tobacco-related adverse pregnancy outcomes and that n-3 LCPUFA supplementation specifically targeted to pregnant smokers may reduce these complications. Support for this hypothesis comes from a recent secondary analysis of the Omega-3 Fatty Acids Supplementation to Prevent Preterm Birth trial that found that only smokers taking n-3 LCPUFAs had a reduction in preterm labor risk as compared to non-smokers. While compelling, this study was a post hoc analysis that included only a small sample of smokers and did not collect data on smoking behaviors during follow up. Yet the ascertainment of longitudinal smoking behavior is critical, as some clinical studies have found that supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs might also reduce nicotine cravings, and lower daily cigarette use. Thus, smokers may doubly benefit from replenishing n-3 LCPUFAs via lower risk of preterm labor and/or increased smoking cessation. To address these knowledge gaps, we are proposing a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in 400 pregnant smokers. We will collect detailed information on smoking behavior, validated biological markers of cigarette exposure (urinary cotinine, end-expiratory carbon monoxide) and biomarkers of n-3 LCPUFA status (red blood cell phospholipid membrane fatty acids). Our specific aims of this proposal are to 1) determine the effect of supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs on gestational age at delivery and preterm labor in pregnant smokers and 2) determine the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on tobacco use in pregnant smokers. We will recruit potential participants from eight obstetrics clinics across the Middle-Tennessee area. Our study could have a major translational impact on both adverse tobacco-related birth outcomes and smoking cessation efforts.","Female","16 Years","40 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~≥ 16 or ≤ 40 years of age~Currently reporting daily cigarette use (≥ 1 CPD; reporting 10 or more CPD prior to pregnancy)~Between 12 and 24 weeks gestation~An exhaled carbon monoxide reading of at least 8 ppm~A cell phone or land line that can be reached directly~Exclusion Criteria:~Allergy to fish; currently using fish oil supplements~Active substance abuse (not including supervised buprenorphine use)~Unable to give consent or obtain assent for minors~Known fetal abnormality~Chronic hypertension~Seizure disorder~Clotting disorder~White's classification D or higher diabetes~Planned cerclage~Plan move from the Middle-Tennessee area within the next 9-months~Insufficient time to perform the complete enrollment process~Barrier to communication (e.g., low English proficiency or hearing/speech impairment)","Included","The trial explicitly targets pregnant smokers to study the effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on gestational age at delivery, preterm labor, and tobacco use.

"256","NCT02188459","Placebo-controlled Trial of Bupropion for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Women","Smoking during pregnancy adversely affects the health of the mother and her developing baby. Maternal smoking approximately doubles the risk of miscarriage, placental complications, preterm delivery, low birth weight and fetal and newborn death. The most common adverse effect of smoking during pregnancy is low birth weight, which sharply increases the risk of the newborn becoming ill or dying. In the US, maternal smoking is responsible for 30% of low birth weight babies, 10% of premature deliveries, and 5% of infant deaths. Fortunately, smoking cessation by pregnancy week 16, or as late as the third trimester, results in a near-normal weight infant at birth. Even reductions in smoking increase birth weight.~Despite the known risks, the majority of women who are smoking at the time of their first prenatal visit continue to smoke. Bupropion is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for smoking cessation in people who are not pregnant, but there are no carefully controlled studies on the use of Bupropion to help pregnant women quit smoking. Bupropion is also FDA approved to treat depression, and some pregnant women have taken it for that purpose, even though it has not been formally tested. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, parallel-group, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 10 week trial of Bupropion in 360 pregnant women who smoke daily and wish to quit smoking.~The study has three primary hypotheses. First, the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will decrease the frequency of smoking more than placebo-treated subjects. Second the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have greater positive pregnancy and child health outcomes than placebo-treated subjects. Third the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have decreased frequency of depressive symptoms and cigarette craving than placebo-treated subjects. These finding will provide information on the safety and efficacy of bupropion treat for smoking cessation in pregnant women.","Female","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Currently smoking on average 3 or more cigarettes per day for the preceding 7 days with a breath CO of at least 5 ppm and wants to quit smoking~Pregnant at 13-26 weeks gestation (to maximize safety and the likelihood of receiving 10 weeks of treatment)~>18 years of age~Able to speak and read English at a 6th grade level or higher, using the Slosson Oral Reading Test (SORT)~Committed to remaining in the geographic area for at least 3 months postpartum~Able to sign written informed consent and commit to completing the procedures involved in the study.~Methadone or buprenorphine-maintained women must be in methadone or buprenorphine treatment for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to entering the study.

"262","NCT01846221","Comparison of Fentanyl-bupivacaine and Clonidine-bupivacaine for Breakthrough Pain in Advanced Labor in Patients With Continuous Epidural Analgesia","Epidural analgesia has proven to be an effective method for severe pain relief associated with labor and delivery. During labor, a low dose continuous infusion of local anesthetic and narcotic will be administered through an epidural catheter. As labor progresses and the baby's head makes it way through the pelvis, breakthrough pain may emerge and often needs further treatment. The investigators provide pain relief by administering analgesics through the epidural catheter. The patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two medication mixtures believed to be successful in treating this type of pain associated with advanced labor. After this initial treatment, if pain relief is not attained, the patient may receive the other medication as well. The medications used in this study have been used at this institution for some time and have been found to be safe for mother and baby. The opioid (fentanyl) dose is small and only a small fraction will be transmitted to the baby. The other medication (clonidine) better known as a blood pressure medication has also been used for pain relief. Studies and clinical experience have shown that clonidine when given epidurally in the doses used in this study has minimal, if any effect, on the blood pressure of the mother or of the baby. The investigators will record medical and obstetric history and labor progress relevant to the patient. The patient will be asked questions regarding labor pain and side effects before and after the analgesic is administered. The primary objective is to determine which treatment regimen is more successful in abolishing breakthrough pain in advanced labor.","Female","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~women in labor at term pregnancy~healthy~epidural analgesia in place~breakthrough pain in advanced labor~Exclusion Criteria:~chronic pain syndrome~receiving systemic opioids within 4 hours~receiving chronic antidepressants, clonidine, opioids","Included","The study explicitly includes women in labor at term pregnancy, focusing on pain relief during advanced labor.","Inclusion Criteria:~women in labor at term pregnancy~",1,0,"0","16.

"273","NCT05873218","Impact of Prophylactic Ephedrine on Fetal Heart Tracing and Uterine Tetanic Contraction After Combined Spinal Epidural on Laboring Parturients","Labor analgesia is an important component of the care of laboring patients. A known side effect of combined spinal and epidural anesthesia (a type of labor analgesia) is an increased incidence of category II fetal heart rate tracing (defined below) and low blood pressure. The study team aims to study if a prophylactic dose of ephedrine will decrease the occurrence of this type of tracing after combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia placement. Ephedrine is not currently routinely used as prevention for category II tracings or low blood pressure. The use of Ephedrine in this study is investigational (this is the first time that the drug has been studied for its effect on these conditions).~Fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings are classified into three categories. In clinical practice, FHR tracing categories are used as a guide to obstetric management and suggest the following approach:~Category I tracing is reactive and reassuring → may continue labor~Category II tracing is neither category I nor category III. For obvious reasons, category II is the broadest and largest category, consisting of various FHR tracing patterns that do not fit into either category I or category III.~Category III tracing is non-reassuring → expedited vaginal or cesarean delivery recommended.~A Category II tracing is not diagnostic. Most pregnancies have at least one Category II tracing.

Attempting to turn babies in-utero is recommended because it may decrease the risk of needing a cesarean section for abnormal presentation. While the study team knows that this procedure can be effective, the study team still has some un-answered questions as to the best way to perform this procedure to increase the chance of success. Many prior studies have shown that using spinal anesthesia (a shot of medication placed in your back to numb and relax the abdomen) can increase the success rate of a version. This ultimately has led to the finding that using this anesthesia can decrease the rate of cesarean section. However, there have been only a small number of studies assessing the success rate if spinal anesthesia is used only in the event that without it fails. Therefore the study team is going to compare patients who receive spinal anesthesia with those who only receive spinal anesthesia if the procedure to turn the baby (ECV) fails without it.","Female","18 Years","60 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~Patients included are those with singleton pregnancies of at least 37 weeks gestation in nonvertex presentation with no contraindication for a vaginal delivery.~Membranes must be intact with a minimum of a 2x2 pocket and Category 1 non-stress test.~Exclusion Criteria:~All patients with a contraindication for a vaginal delivery will be excluded from the study.~Patients with gross fetal anomalies or uterine malformations.~Patients with contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia or allergies to any of the study medications will also be excluded.","Included","The study explicitly includes pregnant individuals as it involves external cephalic version, a procedure performed during pregnancy to turn the baby from the outside.","Patients included are those with singleton pregnancies of at least 37 weeks gestation in nonvertex presentation with no contraindication for a vaginal delivery.",1,0,"0","16.

"285","NCT00711971","Does EPA or DHA Prevent Depressive Symptoms in Pregnancy and Postpartum?","This study is designed to test whether an alternative medicine treatment, fish oil, will prevent depressive symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women who have been found to be at risk for depression. Epidemiologists have observed that people who live in countries where people on average eat a diet high in fish have a lower risk of depression than people who live in populations that eat less fish. Postpartum depression is also less common in these countries. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are thought to be responsible for this beneficial effect of eating fish. The two major omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is an essential building block of the brain and nerve tissue. EPA may act to optimize the electrical signals between nerve cells and brain cells and may help the immune system to function well.~Some researchers have treated people who are already suffering from depression with fish oil. Some of these studies have shown a benefit for the fish oil treatment and others have not. These studies have tested EPA and DHA alone and in various combinations. Currently, it is not known whether EPA or DHA is more effective in preventing and treating depression. Some of the researchers involved in this study have learned how to identify mothers who are most at risk for developing depression during and after pregnancy.

Baseline data for the Bromage and Breen scores during the second stage as well as the uterine contractility data are not available as these indices of motor blockade have not here-to-fore been studied in this context.~Currently at Parkland Hospital, 82% of nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor at term receive continuous epidural infusions with bupivacaine during the first and second stages of labor. Such women will be identified when admitted for scheduled inductions at Parkland. After informed consent is obtained standard management of labor induction will be provided. Those consented women reaching 8 cm cervical dilation will be randomized. Group I will receive bupivacaine plus fentanyl via epidural catheter during the second stage (i.e. 10 cm dilation) and Group II will receive only fentanyl infusion via epidural catheter (see study procedure below). Both the patient and the caregiver will be blinded as to whether the patient is in the bupivacaine plus fentanyl arm or the fentanyl only arm. To detect a 33% increase (from 28 minutes to 37 minutes) in the primary outcome the investigators need a total of 310 women enrolled in the study (or 155 per arm). Assuming a 30% consent rate and given that approximately 1000 women meet the inclusion criteria each year at Parkland, the investigators project that this study could be completed in 12 months.","Female","16 Years","44 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~Nulliparous women at 37 weeks gestation or greater.~Scheduled for induction of labor for any indication, to include hypertensive disorders, diabetes, decreased fetal motion, or prolonged pregnancy.~Single without known malformations.~Maternal age > or equal to 16 years.~ASA classification 1 or 2.~Exclusion Criteria:~Women who refuse epidural analgesia.~Women with contraindications to epidural analgesia, i.e., severe thrombocytopenia.~Any renal disease with serum creatinine > 1.0 mg/dL.~Allergy to bupivacaine or fentanyl.~Known liver disease such as hepatitis.~Known contraindications to internal electronic fetal monitoring i.e., active herpes, maternal HIV seropositivity.","Included","The study explicitly includes nulliparous women at 37 weeks gestation or greater, indicating that pregnant individuals are included in the trial.","Nulliparous women at 37 weeks gestation or greater.",1,0,"0","16.

In addition, we hope to better evaluate the impact of cumulative dose of fentanyl on breastfeeding success in the initial postpartum period as well as at 6 weeks and 6 months post delivery. In order to better assess the quality of breastfeeding, we will utilize a validated breastfeeding assessment tool, LATCH (Latch, Audible swallowing, Type of Nipple, Comfort, and Help). This validated tool can assess maternal and infant variables, define areas of needed intervention, and determine priorities in providing patient teaching. The LATCH assessment has been shown to be a predictor of breastfeeding duration. We also plan to vary the dosage of fentanyl analgesia to determine the relationship between doses below 150 micrograms and changes in breastfeeding assessments. If a clear association between decreased breastfeeding and total fentanyl is identified, then regimens to reduce cumulative doses of fentanyl can be developed to improve the likelihood of breastfeeding success in mothers that desire to breastfeed.~Prior observational studies have inferred epidurals negatively affect breastfeeding by decreasing maternal plasma oxytocin release which may adversely affect infant neurobehavioral development. In a study by Beilin et al., it was reported that mothers receiving a high cumulative dose (> 150 microgram) epidural fentanyl were more likely to have stopped nursing 6 weeks postpartum compared with groups receiving no fentanyl or those receiving < 150 microgram. The study however, was underpowered to detect differences in breastfeeding prior to hospital discharge. In addition, the breastfeeding assessment tool utilized resulted in binary assessments, and therefore, a global rating of the quality of breastfeeding was not available.","Female","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Age 18 and above~English speaking~Term gestation (> 38 weeks)~Parous parturients presenting for attempted vaginal delivery with a cervical dilation less than 8 cm~They must request neuraxial labor analgesia~Have previously successfully breastfed their child postpartum for at least 6 weeks~Are expressing an interest in exclusively breastfeeding postpartum~Exclusion Criteria:~Under 18 years of age~Parturients who have received parental opioids during labor or have taken opioids prenatally~Patients whose neuraxial analgesia failed due to abnormal spinal anatomy including scoliosis or previous spinal instrumentation~Supplemental epidural opioids during labor~Had an expedited labor with the delivery of the fetus less than 90 minutes from the placement of the neuraxial anesthestic~Underwent cesarean delivery~Received general analgesia for an unanticipated postpartum procedure~Dropout criteria include patients who wished to be taken out of the study or were lost to follow-up","Included","The study includes pregnant individuals as it evaluates the impact of neuraxial analgesia on breastfeeding success postpartum.

This pregnancy complication is a major contributor to preterm births and results in neonatal morbidity and mortality. The current standard of care for PPROM subjects between the gestational age of 24 weeks and 0 days and 33 weeks and 6 days, is to administer ampicillin and erythromycin for a total of 7 days. Erythromycin can cause GI upset and some subjects do not tolerate this regimen over the course of 7 days. In addition, there is a national shortage of erythromycin, and published expert opinion proposed to use a second-generation macrolide (azithromycin) instead of erythromycin. Azithromycin can be taken once daily, is cheaper than erythromycin and has less GI upset adverse effects. The investigators' objective is to compare the effectiveness of the 2 regimens in prolonging pregnancy after PPROM. The investigators' working hypothesis is that there is no measurable difference in the primary outcome between the group randomized to the azithromycin regimen versus the group randomized to the erythromycin regimen.","Female","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Maternal age ≥ 18 years and <50 years~Pregnant women between the gestational age 23 6/7 and 32 6/7 weeks~Singleton pregnancy~Preterm premature rupture of membranes, determined clinically~Cervical dilation visually ≤ 5cm on sterile speculum exam.~Planned delivery at John Sealy Hospital (JSH)~Exclusion Criteria:~Intrauterine fetal demise (no fetal heart beat identified and documented by two physicians)~Any contraindication to expectant management (e.g. fetal compromise, chorioamnionitis, placental abruption)~Cervical cerclage in place~Placenta previa or other known placental anomalies~Contraindication to any of the antibiotics used (allergy to macrolides).~Enrolled in another trial that may affect outcome.~Clinical chorioamnionitis or any other active bacterial infection (e.g. pyelonephritis, pneumonia, abscess) at time of randomization: because standard antibiotic therapy for these conditions may confound trial intervention.~No prenatal care (less than 2 prenatal visits)~Non-resident subject who is unlikely to be followed-up after delivery~Any fetal congenital anomaly.~Significant liver disease defined as known cirrhosis or elevated transaminases of at least 3-fold upper limit of normal~Significant renal disease defined as serum creatinine known to be >2.0 mg/dl or on dialysis.~Active congestive heart failure (EF<45%) or pulmonary edema.~Immunosuppressed subjects: i.e., taking systemic immunosuppressants or steroids (e.g. transplant subjects; not including steroids for lung maturity), HIV with CD4<200, or other.","Included","The trial explicitly includes pregnant women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) between 23 6/7 and 32 6/7 weeks of gestation.","Pregnant women between the gestational age 23 6/7 and 32 6/7 weeks",1,0,"0","1.
