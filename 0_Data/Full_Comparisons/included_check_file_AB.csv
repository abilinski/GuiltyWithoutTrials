Differences in the microbiome can affect our immune system in ways that might make some people more likely to get allergies and asthma.~Early life events and exposures are very important for establishing the human microbiome. The newborn baby's microbiome changes very quickly during the first weeks and months of life. There is information that suggests C-section birth is associated with higher risk of certain diseases, including allergies and asthma.

223,NCT04542148,Glycemic Control After Antenatal Corticosteroids in Women With Pregestational and Gestational Diabetes (Close the GAP),"There is a fundamental gap in understanding the maternal and neonatal effects of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration in women with threatened preterm birth (PTB) who have diabetes. Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM, and there is limited data among women with gestational diabetes. While ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS in women with diabetes. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with diabetes as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity.

231,NCT05098067,Trial of Capsaicin Cream as an Adjunctive Therapy for Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy: A Pilot Investigation,"Between fifty and eighty percent of pregnant women experience nausea and vomiting in pregnancy making it one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum is an extreme form of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and results in evidence of acute starvation (i.e. large ketonuria), and weight loss (>5% of a woman's pre-pregnancy weight). Hyperemesis gravidarum is also surprisingly common. In fact, it is the second leading cause of preterm hospitalization during pregnancy, second only preterm labor. Hospitalization is often required because hyperemesis is frequently refractory to common anti-nausea medications. However, capsaicin cream, a potent TRPV1 agonist, commonly used to relieve muscular and neuropathic pain, may be able to reduce the symptoms of nausea and emesis in patients with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Smaller studies have demonstrated capsaicin to be both safe and effective when used to treat intraoperative nausea during cesarean delivery. To begin to address whether capsaicin cream could be used to reduce preterm admissions and shorten emergency room visits for hyperemesis, this study will randomize women presenting to the emergency room for nausea and vomiting to treatment with capsaicin cream as an adjunctive medication or routine care.

Simultaneously, the cesarean delivery (CD) rate has continued to increase (2). Induction is a known risk factor for CD. Despite numerous studies evaluating time periods to define a failed IOL, there are no guidelines or accepted definitions of when to call an IOL failed given the incremental gain in vaginal delivery when IOL is prolonged. While decreasing the CD rate is an important primary focus in obstetrics, attention must also be paid to the overall length of labor given that prolonged labor is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, a prolonged labor is associated with an increase in direct hospital costs and healthcare utilization. The use of cervical ripening agents, such as vaginal prostaglandin and mechanical dilators, has been demonstrated to reduce labor time and CD rate. In addition to specific individual agents, certain dosing and regimens for IOL and active labor have been compared to evaluate whether a particular dose or regimen can decrease the length of labor and decrease the CD rate. Most of these regimens; however, focus on individual induction agents and few have compared the efficacy of using more than one agent simultaneously.

250,NCT02314728,Cervical Ripening in Premature Rupture of Membranes,"Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is diagnosed by demonstrating amniotic fluid in the vaginal canal before the onset of labor. The integrity of the amniotic membrane is compromised thereby increasing the risk of intrauterine infection and compression of the umbilical cord. PROM complicates 3% to 8% of pregnancies in the US and is responsible for 30% of preterm births. Intrauterine infection remains the most significant maternal and neonatal sequelae associated with PROM and this risk increases with the length of time from ruptured membrane to delivery. Induction of labor has been shown to reduce the rates of chorioamnionitis, endometritis and NICU admissions4. Specifically, induction of labor with prostaglandin agents followed by oxytocin, versus oxytocin alone has been shown to be effective for labor induction resulting in vaginal delivery. Management strategies for PROM have been controversial, and published studies on outcomes are over one to two decades old, which does not account for changes in clinical trends and practice patterns. Recently ACOG recommends that patients presenting at 37 weeks gestation or greater with PROM should be induced if not in labor, and generally with oxytocin. In women with PROM without the onset of labor, the cervix is commonly unfavorable and induction with oxytocin alone may lead to an increased risk of cesarean section. With a c-section rate as high as 33%, women undergoing induction of labor have an increased risk of c-section and its associated morbidity and long term sequela. ACOG's recommendation for the use of oxytocin as the induction agent may be meant to avoid a theoretical increased risk of chorioamnionitis in this patient population however it does not take into account the status of the cervix, which may result in a increased risk of c-section. The purpose of the proposed study is to determine whether cervical ripening in women with PROM and an unfavorable cervix is associated with increase rates of vaginal delivery and decreased cesarean section rate compared to induction of labor with oxytocin alone. The investigators aim to determine the incidence of endometritis, and neonatal infection associated with PROM in the current medical environment of antibiotic prophylaxis and antenatal steroid use, taking into account the changes in patient characteristics.",Female,15 Years,50 Years,Inclusion Criteria:~All pregnant women diagnosed with PROM without evidence of labor requiring induction~Gestational Age > 34 weeks~Bishop score < 6~Category I Fetal heart rate tracing~Exclusion Criteria:~Contraindication to Induction of Labor~Multiple gestation~Fetal Anomalies~Previous C-Section~HIV Positive Patients,Included,The study explicitly includes pregnant women diagnosed with PROM without evidence of labor requiring induction.,Inclusion Criteria: All pregnant women diagnosed with PROM without evidence of labor requiring induction,1,0,0,"16.

271,NCT02528981,Effect of Probiotics on GBS Colonization Status During Pregnancy: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in Canada. It may be passed from a study participant colonized in the genital tract by GBS to their baby during vaginal birth. While approximately 10 to 30% of pregnant people harbour GBS in the vagina or rectum, the incidence of neonatal GBS disease is 1 to 2 infants per 1000 births. The use of intrapartum antibiotics to treat colonized individuals with or without risk factors has led to a 70% decline in the incidence of early-onset GBS sepsis in the past decade. Despite this impressive decline, antibiotic resistance has become a major public health concern. Association between intrapartum antibiotic use and ampicillin resistance in E. coli isolated from neonates has previously been documented. Furthermore, while GBS has remained sensitive to penicillin, 20% are resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, which are alternate drugs for patients allergic to penicillin. Alternative approaches are therefore needed to reduce the risk of GBS infection.~We therefore propose to study the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 (Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14) in the colonization status of GBS in pregnant people. Lactobacilli are part of normal gut and vaginal flora and have been widely used as probiotics to treat various conditions. In particular, these two strains have shown to be beneficial in the treatment of urinary tract infections and bacterial vaginosis. Our study design involves recruiting two hundred pregnant people (one hundred in each arm) through various midwifery practices in the GTA at the end of their first trimester of pregnancy. These individuals will be randomized to receive probiotics or placebo for twelve weeks of their pregnancies and will be cultured before delivery to determine their colonization status.

It complicates up to 11 % of all pregnancies and it is responsible for 70% of sick babies. Recently two studies have shown that giving progesterone (a normal hormone made by the ovaries) prolongs gestation in women who have had a preterm birth in an earlier pregnancy (and therefore are at risk for another early delivery). There are other studies that show that this technique of giving a weekly shot of progesterone does not prevent preterm birth. In addition, There are other groups of patients who are at very high risk for preterm birth which have not been studied. They include: 1.) Cervical cerclage (a stitch in the mouth of the womb); 2.) Multifetal gestation (twins, triplets, etc.); 3.) Women with preterm (<34 weeks) rupture of the membranes; 4.) Women with preterm labor during the current pregnancy with intact membranes who have been tocolyzed (have their labor stopped and are getting ready to go home). We purpose to give weekly shots of progesterone or a placebo in a randomized fashion to women in the first group who are at risk for preterm delivery due to an early birth in a previous pregnancy as well as the other four groups listed.

In a recent clinical trial (MOTHER), buprenorphine was associated with superior neonatal outcomes such as shorter duration of treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) compared to methadone. However, buprenorphine was also associated with greater study discontinuation (33% vs. 18%) and illicit opioid use (33% vs. 23%) compared to methadone. Treatment dropout often leads to relapse and resumption of high-risk behaviors, overshadowing any short-term improvement in neonatal outcomes. Therefore, The goal of this K23 proposal is to conduct a pilot study to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized comparative effectiveness clinical trial comparing office-based buprenorphine vs. federally licensed methadone programs for the treatment of OD pregnant women.~A pilot study is critical to develop the outcome measures, assessment tools and participant tracking techniques necessary for a future, large-scale comparative effectiveness clinical trial.

327,NCT04417595,Investigating N-3 Fatty Acids to Prevent Neonatal Tobacco-related outcomeS,"Smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth, neonatal death, and maternal complications. Rates of smoking cessation during pregnancy are low, particularly in underserved populations, and currently approved pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation either are considered unsafe in pregnancy or have uncertain effectiveness. Identifying safe and effective interventions, which might mitigate the adverse effects of smoking on maternal-fetal outcomes, is a major public health priority. We hypothesize that smoking-induced n-3 LCPUFA relative deficiencies may be an important mechanism contributing to tobacco-related adverse pregnancy outcomes and that n-3 LCPUFA supplementation specifically targeted to pregnant smokers may reduce these complications. Support for this hypothesis comes from a recent secondary analysis of the Omega-3 Fatty Acids Supplementation to Prevent Preterm Birth trial that found that only smokers taking n-3 LCPUFAs had a reduction in preterm labor risk as compared to non-smokers. While compelling, this study was a post hoc analysis that included only a small sample of smokers and did not collect data on smoking behaviors during follow up. Yet the ascertainment of longitudinal smoking behavior is critical, as some clinical studies have found that supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs might also reduce nicotine cravings, and lower daily cigarette use. Thus, smokers may doubly benefit from replenishing n-3 LCPUFAs via lower risk of preterm labor and/or increased smoking cessation. To address these knowledge gaps, we are proposing a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in 400 pregnant smokers. We will collect detailed information on smoking behavior, validated biological markers of cigarette exposure (urinary cotinine, end-expiratory carbon monoxide) and biomarkers of n-3 LCPUFA status (red blood cell phospholipid membrane fatty acids). Our specific aims of this proposal are to 1) determine the effect of supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs on gestational age at delivery and preterm labor in pregnant smokers and 2) determine the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on tobacco use in pregnant smokers.

345,NCT02188459,Placebo-controlled Trial of Bupropion for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Women,"Smoking during pregnancy adversely affects the health of the mother and her developing baby. Maternal smoking approximately doubles the risk of miscarriage, placental complications, preterm delivery, low birth weight and fetal and newborn death. The most common adverse effect of smoking during pregnancy is low birth weight, which sharply increases the risk of the newborn becoming ill or dying. In the US, maternal smoking is responsible for 30% of low birth weight babies, 10% of premature deliveries, and 5% of infant deaths. Fortunately, smoking cessation by pregnancy week 16, or as late as the third trimester, results in a near-normal weight infant at birth. Even reductions in smoking increase birth weight.~Despite the known risks, the majority of women who are smoking at the time of their first prenatal visit continue to smoke. Bupropion is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for smoking cessation in people who are not pregnant, but there are no carefully controlled studies on the use of Bupropion to help pregnant women quit smoking. Bupropion is also FDA approved to treat depression, and some pregnant women have taken it for that purpose, even though it has not been formally tested. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, parallel-group, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 10 week trial of Bupropion in 360 pregnant women who smoke daily and wish to quit smoking.~The study has three primary hypotheses. First, the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will decrease the frequency of smoking more than placebo-treated subjects. Second the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have greater positive pregnancy and child health outcomes than placebo-treated subjects. Third the investigators hypothesize that Bupropion treated subjects will have decreased frequency of depressive symptoms and cigarette craving than placebo-treated subjects.

During labor, a low dose continuous infusion of local anesthetic and narcotic will be administered through an epidural catheter. As labor progresses and the baby's head makes it way through the pelvis, breakthrough pain may emerge and often needs further treatment. The investigators provide pain relief by administering analgesics through the epidural catheter. The patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two medication mixtures believed to be successful in treating this type of pain associated with advanced labor. After this initial treatment, if pain relief is not attained, the patient may receive the other medication as well. The medications used in this study have been used at this institution for some time and have been found to be safe for mother and baby. The opioid (fentanyl) dose is small and only a small fraction will be transmitted to the baby. The other medication (clonidine) better known as a blood pressure medication has also been used for pain relief. Studies and clinical experience have shown that clonidine when given epidurally in the doses used in this study has minimal, if any effect, on the blood pressure of the mother or of the baby. The investigators will record medical and obstetric history and labor progress relevant to the patient. The patient will be asked questions regarding labor pain and side effects before and after the analgesic is administered.

A known side effect of combined spinal and epidural anesthesia (a type of labor analgesia) is an increased incidence of category II fetal heart rate tracing (defined below) and low blood pressure. The study team aims to study if a prophylactic dose of ephedrine will decrease the occurrence of this type of tracing after combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia placement. Ephedrine is not currently routinely used as prevention for category II tracings or low blood pressure. The use of Ephedrine in this study is investigational (this is the first time that the drug has been studied for its effect on these conditions).~Fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings are classified into three categories. In clinical practice, FHR tracing categories are used as a guide to obstetric management and suggest the following approach:~Category I tracing is reactive and reassuring → may continue labor~Category II tracing is neither category I nor category III. For obvious reasons, category II is the broadest and largest category, consisting of various FHR tracing patterns that do not fit into either category I or category III.~Category III tracing is non-reassuring → expedited vaginal or cesarean delivery recommended.~A Category II tracing is not diagnostic. Most pregnancies have at least one Category II tracing. There is not always an identifiable reason for a Category II tracing.~Ephedrine is a medication that causes an increase in heart rate and blood pressure while also causing some degree of relaxation of the uterus therefore improving uterine blood flow. It has been used in the obstetric population for over 50 years without issues.

385,NCT00711971,Does EPA or DHA Prevent Depressive Symptoms in Pregnancy and Postpartum?,"This study is designed to test whether an alternative medicine treatment, fish oil, will prevent depressive symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women who have been found to be at risk for depression. Epidemiologists have observed that people who live in countries where people on average eat a diet high in fish have a lower risk of depression than people who live in populations that eat less fish. Postpartum depression is also less common in these countries. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are thought to be responsible for this beneficial effect of eating fish. The two major omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is an essential building block of the brain and nerve tissue. EPA may act to optimize the electrical signals between nerve cells and brain cells and may help the immune system to function well.~Some researchers have treated people who are already suffering from depression with fish oil. Some of these studies have shown a benefit for the fish oil treatment and others have not. These studies have tested EPA and DHA alone and in various combinations. Currently, it is not known whether EPA or DHA is more effective in preventing and treating depression. Some of the researchers involved in this study have learned how to identify mothers who are most at risk for developing depression during and after pregnancy.

This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to address the primary research question: Does bupivacaine lengthen the second stage of labor? The secondary research question is: Is there other evidence of motor blockade attributable to bupivacaine during the second stage of labor?~The investigators know from prior studies that the length of the second stage in nulliparous women delivered at Parkland Hospital without epidural analgesia is 28 minutes. The investigators hypothesize in this now proposed study that epidural analgesia with bupivacaine will significantly increase this baseline from 28 minutes to 37 minutes or more (a 33% increase) thus implicating motor blockade. Baseline data for the Bromage and Breen scores during the second stage as well as the uterine contractility data are not available as these indices of motor blockade have not here-to-fore been studied in this context.~Currently at Parkland Hospital, 82% of nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor at term receive continuous epidural infusions with bupivacaine during the first and second stages of labor. Such women will be identified when admitted for scheduled inductions at Parkland. After informed consent is obtained standard management of labor induction will be provided. Those consented women reaching 8 cm cervical dilation will be randomized. Group I will receive bupivacaine plus fentanyl via epidural catheter during the second stage (i.e. 10 cm dilation) and Group II will receive only fentanyl infusion via epidural catheter (see study procedure below). Both the patient and the caregiver will be blinded as to whether the patient is in the bupivacaine plus fentanyl arm or the fentanyl only arm.

448,NCT03595982,Is Procardia XL 60 mg Q Daily Equivalent to 30 mg XL Given Twice Daily?,"Antihypertensive therapy has been used in pregnant patients antepartum to improve blood pressure (BP) elevation in cases of chronic hypertension, and postpartum for persistent hypertension after delivery in cases of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, as well as for management of chronic hypertension.~There is limited evidence regarding the precise BP level at which antihypertensive therapy is indicated during pregnancy for chronic hypertension. Treatment has been suggested in pregnant patients when systolic BP is ≥ 160 mmHg and at a lower diastolic BP threshold of 105 mm Hg, however some providers may initiate therapy at systolic BPs ≥ 150 mmHg.~Nifedipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator and an ideal first line antihypertensive agent due to its low maternal side-effect profile. It has been proven to be safe in pregnancy. Conventional nifedipine can be started at 10 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 120 mg/d, but frequently extended release tablets are preferred due to steady blood pressure control with once daily administration.~It is frequently used however as a twice daily dosing as many providers have noticed an increase in the BPs 12-24h from administration. Twice daily dosing might produce overlapping profiles that prevent elevation of BP at the time of the next administration and breakthrough elevations throughout the day in pregnant women.~The aim of this study is to investigate the mean plasma levels and standard deviations of Procardia at 24h after Procardia XL is administered as a 60 mg daily dose and the mean plasma levels after it is given as a 30 mg twice-daily dose. This will be a pilot study for a future randomized control trial that will allow the researchers to determine whether 60 mg daily of Procardia XL is equivalent to 30 mg twice daily. Secondary outcome will be effective control of BP throughout the day (0h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h, 20h and 24h) defined as BPs below 160/105 as well as side effects of nifedipine as reported by patients.",Female,18 Years,55 Years,"Inclusion Criteria:~Antepartum or postpartum patients between the age of 18-55 requiring 60 mg of Procardia XL to control elevated blood pressures secondary to preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or chronic hypertension.~Exclusion Criteria:~All patients receiving other antihypertensive medication~All patients with a contraindication to nifedipine: Hypersensitivity to nifedipine or other calcium -channel blocker, cardiogenic shock, concomitant administration with strong CYP34A inducers (rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St Johns Wort) → significantly reduces nifedipine efficacy, impaired liver function→?

467,NCT01074190,The Effect of Neuraxial Analgesia on Maternal Breastfeeding,"A previous randomized trial showed a possible negative association with labor neuraxial analgesia with high compared to low doses of fentanyl, and breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum. The significance of this study would be to validate or refute these findings. In addition, we hope to better evaluate the impact of cumulative dose of fentanyl on breastfeeding success in the initial postpartum period as well as at 6 weeks and 6 months post delivery. In order to better assess the quality of breastfeeding, we will utilize a validated breastfeeding assessment tool, LATCH (Latch, Audible swallowing, Type of Nipple, Comfort, and Help). This validated tool can assess maternal and infant variables, define areas of needed intervention, and determine priorities in providing patient teaching. The LATCH assessment has been shown to be a predictor of breastfeeding duration. We also plan to vary the dosage of fentanyl analgesia to determine the relationship between doses below 150 micrograms and changes in breastfeeding assessments. If a clear association between decreased breastfeeding and total fentanyl is identified, then regimens to reduce cumulative doses of fentanyl can be developed to improve the likelihood of breastfeeding success in mothers that desire to breastfeed.~Prior observational studies have inferred epidurals negatively affect breastfeeding by decreasing maternal plasma oxytocin release which may adversely affect infant neurobehavioral development. In a study by Beilin et al., it was reported that mothers receiving a high cumulative dose (> 150 microgram) epidural fentanyl were more likely to have stopped nursing 6 weeks postpartum compared with groups receiving no fentanyl or those receiving < 150 microgram. The study however, was underpowered to detect differences in breastfeeding prior to hospital discharge.
