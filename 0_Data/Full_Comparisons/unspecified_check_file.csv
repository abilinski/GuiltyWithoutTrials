This proposal is a laboratory and treatment outcome study to examine the effects of guanfacine on brief exposure to stress, drug cues and neutral situations on cocaine/alcohol craving, mood and neurobiological reactivity in a sample of cocaine and/or alcohol dependent individuals. Guanfacine will be beneficial for reduction in stress and drug cue induced craving and related arousal.

"35","NCT01598480","To Study the Healing Effect of Silver Impregnated Activated Carbon Fiber Wound Dressing on Superficial Dermal Burn","Background:~Bio-medical Carbon Technology (BCT) Antimicrobial Dressing, a novel advanced wound dressing invented by Bio-medical Carbon Technology Co., Ltd., Taiwan, consists principally of activated carbon fiber impregnated with silver particles. The highly porous nature and the large specific surface area of activated carbon fiber provide a tremendous adsorptive capacity for toxins, wound degradation products, and odors. Furthermore, far infrared ray emitted from activated carbon fiber accelerates blood circulation to stimulate tissue regeneration. Silver ions efficiently eliminate a broad spectrum of bacteria through penetrating the cell wall of bacteria and denaturing essential proteins. This clinical trial investigates wound healing effects of BCT Antimicrobial Dressing on superficial dermal burn patients.~Aim:~To investigate wound healing effects of BCT Antimicrobial Dressing on superficial dermal burn.~Methods:~This trial is expected to recruit 30 eligible subjects. After hospitalized patients are diagnosed as superficial dermal burn, the procedure of Informed Consent is conducted by the project investigator. As long as the patient agrees to join this clinical trial and signs the Informed Consent, two separate areas of 25 cm2 in the same anatomic site are chosen and distributed to the control and research groups respectively by coin flipping. The wound in the research group is first cleansed with normal saline and then applied with BCT Antimicrobial Dressing and covered by sterile gauze, and dressings will be changed every 3 days (counting from the day applied BCT dressings: Day0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15……etc.) until the wound is healed.

"64","NCT03172026","Maraviroc to Augment Rehabilitation Outcomes After Stroke","After stroke, the combination of progressive skills practice in an adequate dose, exercise for fitness, and reduced sedentary time will augment motor and cognitive outcomes. Sensorimotor and cognitive improvements after stroke often reach a general plateau by approximately 12 weeks after onset, however. Drugs that might enhance learning or neural repair, as well as other molecular and synaptic adaptations that occur during skills training and fitness exercise, might extend that recovery curve, although to date only fluoxetine has given any hint of this. Most trials have tested agents that modulate neurotransmitters. Several very recent preclinical experiments and observational studies in patients after stroke suggest that the commercially available medication, Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist, may augment skills learning during rehabilitation training, especially during the first three months after onset, by affecting CREB and synaptic plasticity.~The investigators will carry out a randomized controlled trial of Maraviroc in patients with disabilities severe enough to have required inpatient stroke rehabilitation and, based on our preclinical data, who can start the drug intervention within 6 weeks of stroke onset. The investigators will compare usual post-stroke care plus placebo versus Maraviroc given for 8 weeks in 60 participants. However, to try to maximize the amount of practice that is most relevant to the primary outcome measurements and determine whether or not Maraviroc can enhance the effects of training, as hypothesized, all participants will be tele-monitored by mobile health devices and will receive weekly telephonic encouragement, based on device data, to walk, reduce sedentary time, and reach and grasp in the home in between usual care therapies.

Approximately 140 patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive treatment with either roniciclib or placebo in combination with chemotherapy.~Roniciclib is an oral (i.e. taken by mouth) protein kinase inhibitor. A kinase inhibitor targets certain key proteins that are essential for the survival of the cancer cell. The growth of the tumor may be decreased by preventing these specific proteins from functioning. By specifically targeting these proteins, roniciclib in combination with chemotherapy may stop cancer growth.~The primary endpoint (the most meaningful result to be tracked) of this study is based on the progression free survival, i.e. the time the disease is not worsening. The aim is to show that the therapy with roniciclib in combination with chemotherapy prolongs the time the disease is not worsening in this patient population compared to patients receiving placebo in combination with chemotherapy.","All","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Male or female subjects aged ≥18 years (or country-specific legal age of maturity, if >18 years)~Histologically or cytologically confirmed (extensive-stage disease) ED SCLC (small cell lung cancer)~At least 1 solid tumor lesion measurable by computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1~Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 1~Exclusion Criteria:~Prior systemic anticancer therapy for SCLC (including previous therapy with a cyclin-dependent kinase [CDK] inhibitor)","Unspecified","The study does not mention pregnant individuals in the inclusion or exclusion criteria.

"70","NCT04698031","Stroke and Coated-Platelets - A Translational Research Initiative","Silent brain infarctions (SBIs) are a manifestation of covert cerebrovascular disease, without obvious clinical deficit, noted very often in patients presenting with a new stroke or new transient ischemic attack. SBIs are linked to a significant increase in risk for subsequent stroke and cognitive decline. However, no biomarker is currently available that can predict the recurrence of these subclinical lesions. Coated-platelets are a measure of platelet procoagulant potential significantly increased in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack compared to unaffected controls. Higher coated-platelet levels are strongly associated with both the presence and number of SBIs. Among medications approved for preventing stroke recurrence, we identified clopidogrel as a pharmacological agent leading to a decrease in coated-platelet levels. In this project, we plan to evaluate if clopidogrel can decrease the rate of occurrence of new silent brain infarctions. The result will enhance the investigators understanding of the relationship between platelets and silent brain infarcts, leading to improved health care delivery and also potential targets for novel preventive pharmacological interventions.","All","21 Years","90 Years","Inclusion Criteria:~diagnosis of ischemic stroke/TIA~< 90 days from onset of symptoms~initial MRI available,~not receiving antiplatelet therapy at the time of admission~medical decision by the treating physician that antiplatelet therapy is indicated for secondary prevention (decision independent of the study and based on individual clinical decision for each patient).~baseline coated-platelet levels at 40%,~willingness to participate in the study for 24 months~Exclusion Criteria:~dementia (based on chart review or self/proxy report)~> 90 days from onset of symptoms~initiation of anticoagulation or thrombolytics prior to phlebotomy~intracranial hemorrhage or bleeding diatheses~end-stage renal disease (ESRD)~inability to tolerate consenting or phlebotomy~prior adverse/allergic reactions to clopidogrel~treating physician deemed a different antiplatelet dose or dual antiplatelet therapy as the only treatment choice","Unspecified","The study does not mention pregnancy, lactating, contraceptives, or childbearing in the inclusion or exclusion criteria.
