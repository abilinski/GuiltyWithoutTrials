The hypothesis is that the use of TSR-042, checkpoint inhibitor, as consolidation therapy following concurrent chemo-radiation would increase PFS in these patients. The incorporation of immunotherapy after chemo-radiation is one the best scenarios for this approach, since takes advantages of the ideal microenvironment created after radiation. In a similar rationale, the phase 3 study that compared the anti-programmed death ligand 1 antibody durvalumab as consolidation therapy with placebo in patients with stage III NSCLC who did not have disease progression after two or more cycles of platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, showed that progression-free survival was significantly longer with durvalumab than with placebo in all sub-groups regardless of response obtained to chemotherapy, namely patients with stable disease (SD) gained the same benefit that patients with partial response (PR). Due to the aforementioned biology of cervical cancer, the proven activity of anti programmed cell death protein 1 (Anti-PD1) agents in metastatic and/or recurrent cervical cancer and the poor PFS and OS in patients with LACC despite definitive chemo-radiotherapy, we consider to analyze the Anti-PD1 agent, TSR-042 as maintenance therapy after concurrent chemo-radiation (CCRT)","Female","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Signed informed consent before any study-specific procedure~Participant must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 1~Participant must be a female ≥ 18 years of age~Life expectancy ≥3 months~Participant must have biopsy-confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix.~Patients must have archival tumor tissue available that is formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded.~At diagnosis:~Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) stages IB2, IIA2, IIB with pelvic lymph node involvement: Biopsy-proven pelvic node involvement, 2 or more positive nodes by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) (≥1.5 cm shortest dimension), 2 or more positive nodes by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (with standardized uptake values (SUV) ≥2.5)~FIGO stages IIIA, IIIB, IVA~Any FIGO stage with para-aortic lymph node involvement: Biopsy-proven para-aortic node involvement, 1 or more positive nodes by MRI or CT (≥1.5 cm shortest dimension), 1 or more positive pelvic nodes by PET (with SUV ≥ 2.5)~Subjects must have received combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CCRT) with curative intent.

Indeed, ICB have emerged as a fatal weapon in the anticancer treatment arsenal. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies have shown promising results in several cancers including Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients. Although such ICB extend patient's survival compared with conventional systemic therapies, they fail to control cancer progression in a significant proportion of patients which can reach up to 50-60% in NSCLC. Recent literature highlights a range of factors involved in the heterogeneous responses and failures to ICB therapies. The challenge is how can ICB treatment efficacy be extended to majority patients? To respond to this question, to increase the success of immunotherapy, immuno-oncology community develops combinations approaches.~The aim of these project is to evaluate the efficacy of Nivolumab plus a novel CD4Th1 inducer anti-cancer vaccine in NSCLC patients.~Nivolumab (NIVO), which is an anti-PD-1 antibody, has shown promising results in 2nd line treatment for advanced NSCLC.~UCPVax is a therapeutic anti-cancer vaccine based on the telomerase-derived helper peptides designed to induce strong TH1 CD4 T cell responses in cancer patients (NCT02818426).","All","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Signed informed consent~Age ≥ 18 years~Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma or other)~Advanced NSCLC cancer patient with progressive disease after a first line of combo chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1 or chemotherapy plus anti-PD-L1 combination~Measurable disease defined according to iRECIST v1.1 guidelines~Patients must have a mandatory treatment-free interval of at least 21 days following previous systemic anti-cancer treatments~Patients who have received previous systemic anticancer treatment and/or radiotherapy should have recovered from any treatment related toxicity, to a level of ≤ grade 1 with the exception of Grade 2 alopecia~Performance status 0 or 1 on the ECOG scale~Females must be using highly effective contraceptive measures and have a negative pregnancy test prior to the start of dosing if of childbearing potential, or must have evidence of non-childbearing potential.

Radioactive drugs, such as 177-Lutetium-PSMA, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. SBRT uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving 177-Lutetium-PSMA before SBRT may make the SBRT more effective.","All","18 Years","N/A","Inclusion Criteria:~Oligorecurrent prostate cancer as determined by the presence of 1-5 asymptomatic lesions outside the prostate or prostate bed identified on PSMA PET/CT by local readers~Age >= 18 years~Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2~No indication for urgent or emergent radiation~Histologic confirmation of prostate adenocarcinoma (histology from original treatment acceptable)~White blood cell count >= 2.5 × 10^9/L~Platelets >= 100 × 10^9/L~Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL~Total bilirubin =< 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); or up to 3 × ULN if known history of Gilbert's syndrome~Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase =< 3.0 × ULN or =< 5.0 × ULN for patients with liver metastases~Serum creatinine =< 1.5 × ULN or creatinine clearance >= 50 mL/min~Serum albumin > 3.0 g/dL~Partner and patient must use a method of birth control with adequate barrier protection, deemed acceptable by the principal investigator during the study and for 3 months after last study drug administration~Ability to understand, and willingness to sign, the written informed consent~Exclusion Criteria:~Patients with neuroendocrine or small cell carcinoma of the prostate~Patients with castrate-resistant disease (i.e., PSA > 0.5 ng/mL with serum testosterone < 150 ng/dL)~Patients who received androgen deprivation therapy within 6 months of trial enrollment~Concurrent systemic therapy for a solid organ malignancy~Spinal cord compression~Inability to lie flat~Known hypersensitivity to components of 177Lu-PNT2002~Serum creatinine > 1.5 × ULN or creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min~Total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN or > 3.0 × ULN if known history of Gilbert's syndrome~Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase > 3 × ULN (or 5 × ULN for patients with known liver metastases)~De novo oligometastatic disease","Excluded","Pregnant individuals are excluded as the study requires the use of birth control with adequate barrier protection for both the partner and patient during the study and for 3 months after the last study drug administration.","Partner and patient must use a method of birth control with adequate barrier protection, deemed acceptable by the principal investigator during the study and for 3 months after last study drug administration",TRUE
