1,NCT06168461,Aspirin for the Treatment of Vascular Dysfunction After Preeclampsia,"Women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy are four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease later in life, even if they are otherwise healthy. The reason why this occurs may be related to lasting blood vessel damage after the pregnancy but there are currently no specific treatment strategies to prevent this disease progression. This study addresses this public health issue by examining whether starting low dose aspirin therapy after pregnancy is an effective treatment for lasting blood vessel damage in order to inform better clinical management of cardiovascular disease risk in women who have had preeclampsia.","Inclusion Criteria:~had preeclampsia in the past 5 years,~18 years or older~Exclusion criteria:~current daily aspirin use,~skin diseases,~current tobacco or nicotine use (including vaping),~diagnosed or suspected hepatic or metabolic disease including chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as reduced eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2,~statin or other cholesterol-lowering medication,~current antihypertensive medication,~history of hypertension prior to pregnancy,~history of gestational diabetes,~currently pregnancy,~body mass index <18.5 kg/m2,~allergy to materials used during the experiment.(e.g. latex),~known allergies to study drugs,~bleeding disorders, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, GI bleeding and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).",Postpartum intervention,This study addresses this public health issue by examining whether starting low dose aspirin therapy after pregnancy is an effective treatment for lasting blood vessel damage.,1,1,This study addresses this public health issue by examining whether starting low dose aspirin therapy after pregnancy is an effective treatment for lasting blood vessel damage,1

GDM is often the culmination of years of unrecognized and unmodified diabetes risk factors that lead to overt and occult clinical manifestations during pregnancy. Systematic reviews of older studies conclude that 35-60% women with gestational diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes (DM2) at rates much greater than control groups who did not have glucose intolerance during pregnancy. Liraglutide may potentially delay disease progression in GDM considering the beta -(ß-)cell function improvement in DM2 and ß-cell mass shown to increase in animal models.

Postpartum and breastfeeding are relative hypoestrogenic states with risk factors for dyspareunia and vaginal atrophy. Estrogen deficiency results in changes in the vaginal epithelium and poor tissue quality which results in poor wound healing. For postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse, early administration of topical vaginal E2 therapy resulted in improved markers of tissue quality. Currently, there are limited studies to reference for proposed treatment modalities to improve sexual function and incontinence in this population. In this proposed randomized, placebo-controlled trial, women who sustain OASIS will be recruited and randomized to begin intravaginal estrogen therapy or placebo at their 2-week follow-up visit after hospital discharge. Participants will complete validated questionnaires relating to sexual function and pelvic floor disorders (urinary and anal incontinence) symptom distress and impact. The primary outcome of this study will be sexual dysfunction symptom severity measured by the female sexual function index (FSFI) at 6 months postpartum. Secondary outcomes will be urinary and anal incontinence distress and impact measured by St. Mark's score and the fecal incontinence quality of life (FIQOL) questionnaire for anal incontinence and urogenital distress inventory (UDI-6) for urinary incontinence.

37,NCT02070237,Comparing Anti-XA Levels in Post-Cesarean Patients With BMI >35 Undergoing Enoxaparin Thromboprophylaxis With Weight Based Dosing Twice Daily Versus Fixed Dose 40 Milligrams Daily,"Pregnant and recently postpartum women are at significantly higher risk of developing a blood clot in their arms or legs known as a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or a blood clot in their lungs known as a pulmonary embolism (PE) compared to their non pregnant counterparts. It is estimated that this risk increases anywhere from 4 to 50 times higher in pregnant versus non-pregnant women and further increases almost 11 fold in the post partum period. This risk is almost doubled when the patient undergoes cesarean delivery. In 2011, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued updated guidelines stating that for patients undergoing cesarean delivery with additional risk factors for clot or thromboembolism, protective (prophylactic) treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) a type of blood thinner should be considered. However, no specific guidelines about which risk factors should be considered, or what medication doses should be used were provided. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines published in 2012 delineated who should be given prophylaxis based on various risk factors, however acknowledged that the recommendations were based on weak quality evidence.~ACOG endorses either once or twice a day dosing for high risk patients after delivery and states that adjustments for obese women should be made on a case by case basis. However, there are limited studies on the dosing of LMWH in specific subpopulations including post operative patients, pregnant patients and obese patients. All of these studies have urged further investigation of the correct dosing for these high risk subjects due to changes associated with pregnancy and the level of medication in the blood that may put these patients at higher risk of venous thromboembolism. Many previous studies have shown that women in these high risk categories do not achieve protective levels of the medication measured with a laboratory test; anti Xa level. The investigators hypothesize that due to their dual risk, obese post-operative recently pregnant women may not be adequately protected with the daily fixed dose and might need more frequent dosing to protect them.~The objective of this study is to assess what proportion of women achieve the desired anti Xa level with the fixed daily dose versus twice daily weight based dosing (0.5 mg/kg).","Inclusion Criteria:~Women with a body mass index >35 who have undergone cesarean delivery in the last 12 hours who will receive thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin~Subjects who consent to the study.~Exclusion Criteria:~Women with a previous history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism~Women who are currently receiving another form of low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin.~Women who are receiving other concomitant anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin, lepirudin, or argatroban.~Subjects who are unable or unwilling to give informed consent.~Women who, in the judgment of the investigators, would not be in the best interest of the patient to participate in the study.~Allergy to enoxaparin.~Women with renal impairment~Women with contraindications to Lovenox treatment such as women with active bleeding or thrombocytopenia",Enrolls postpartum,Women with a body mass index >35 who have undergone cesarean delivery in the last 12 hours who will receive thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin,1,1,Women with a body mass index >35 who have undergone cesarean delivery in the last 12 hours who will receive thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin,

Additionally, this study aims to compare the acceptability of bleeding in postpartum adolescents who have an etonogestrel contraceptive implant prior to discharge versus those with insertion at the six week postpartum visit.

Decline in bone density with lactation occurs rapidly. Although bone density increases after weaning, there is controversy on whether or not it is completely restored. Epidemiological studies find no significant negative impact of lactation on bone mass or fractures, and in fact there is evidence that lactation has a positive effect on bone mass. We think that interventions that attenuate this physiologic loss of bone that is associated with lactation and accelerate restoration of bone mass after weaning may result in improved long term bone mass and diminished fracture risk.",Inclusion Criteria:~Fully lactating mothers age 18 and up~Within 1 month after delivery~Plan to breast feed for at least 6 months~Exclusion Criteria:~Known metabolic bone disease~Chronic renal insufficiency~Chronic corticosteroid use~Eating disorder~Estrogen containing hormonal contraception use~Daily use of >400IU Vitamin D supplementation~Delivery of Multiples~Delivery of a singleton with a birth weight of <2500 grams~Preterm delivery of baby~History of kidney stones,Enrolls postpartum,Inclusion Criteria:~Fully lactating mothers age 18 and up~Within 1 month after delivery~Plan to breast feed for at least 6 months,1,1,Within 1 month after delivery,

55,NCT01292447,A Randomized Controlled Trial of 2% Lidocaine Gel for IUD Insertion,"The intrauterine device (IUD) is a long-acting, highly effective, reversible contraceptive that may be underutilized due to fear of pain during insertion. Although providers frequently prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for IUD insertion, there is no evidence for any pain reduction. In fact, no interventions evaluated in randomized controlled trials have been shown to be effective in reducing pain during IUD insertion. While many women tolerate IUD insertion well, others have moderate to severe pain. This double-blind randomized controlled trial of 150 women aims to estimate the efficacy of intracervical 2% lidocaine gel compared to placebo (KY jelly) to reduce IUD insertion pain.

The gold standard treatment for a PDPH is currently an epidural blood patch (EBP), which involves placing a needle back into the epidural space of the neuraxium and then injecting 20 ml of the patient's own blood through the needle and into the epidural space to form a clot over the insult in the tissue layer that causes the headaches. The investigators want to test the efficacy of using a less invasive procedure, called a sphenopalatine block (SPGB), for treatment of PDPH. SPGB has been used for many years in the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches, and there are several case reports of its use to successfully treat PDPH as well. SPGB simply involves applying a local anesthetic to the mucosa in the back of each nostril to numb the nerves that cause the headache.

79,NCT00225108,The Cesarean Section Thromboprophylaxis Pilot Study:A Randomized Open-Label Controlled Pilot Study of Prophylactic Low Molecular Weight Heparin in High Risk Postpartum Women Following Cesarean Section,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the most common cause of maternal death in the developed world. VTE includes two conditions, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT refers to a blood clot that has formed in a deep vein, often in the legs and/or pelvis and PE refers to the passage of these clots into the lungs (which can be fatal). VTE is up to 10 times more common in pregnant women than non-pregnant women of comparable age. More than a third of pregnancy related VTE occur during the 6 weeks after delivery. When compared with vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery further increases the risk of pregnancy associated VTE by three-fold.~A medication called low molecular weight heparin is sometimes prescribed during pregnancy and after delivery to prevent VTE. However, clinical practice varies because there hasn't been adequate research to determine that this medication is safe and effective at preventing VTE during this time. The potential benefits of the medication must also be weighed against its cost and possible side effects.~The researchers are conducting a study that will assess the effectiveness and safety of low molecular weight heparin in women who are at moderate to high risk of VTE after a cesarean section. They will monitor these women to determine if those who received the medication have fewer blood clots. Participants will also be monitored closely for any side effects.","Inclusion Criteria (must meet inclusion criteria 1, 2 and 3):~At high risk for thromboembolism (any one of the following):~Age > 35 years~Obesity (> 80 kg)~Para &#61619;4~Gross varicose veins~Current infection~Pre-eclampsia~Immobility prior to surgery (> 4 days)~Major current disease: includes heart or lung disease, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and nephrotic syndrome.~Emergency cesarean section in labour~Extended major pelvic or abdominal surgery (e.g. cesarean hysterectomy)~Patients with a family history of VTE~History of superficial phlebitis~Delivered by cesarean section (emergency or planned)~Signed, informed consent~Exclusion Criteria (must not meet any of the following criteria):~Greater than 36 hours since delivery~Need for anticoagulation, including:~Women with a confirmed thrombophilia~Women with paralysis of lower limbs~Women with personal history of VTE~Women with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLA)~Women with mechanical heart valves~Contraindication to heparin therapy, including:~History of heparin induced thrombocytopenia~Platelet count of less than 100,000 x 10^6/L~Hemoglobin <= 90 g/L or a greater than 30 g/L drop in hemoglobin compared to last antepartum result~History of osteoporosis~History of steroid use (one week or more)~Active bleeding~Documented peptic ulcer within 6 weeks~Heparin, bisulfite, or fish allergy~Severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] > 200 and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] > 120)~Severe hepatic failure (International Normalized Ratio [INR] > 1.8)~Women with serum creatinine > 80 and an abnormal 24 hour creatinine clearance.~Contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including:~Women with electrically, magnetically or mechanically activated implants~Women with claustrophobia~Women < 18 years of age",Enrolls postpartum,More than a third of pregnancy related VTE occur during the 6 weeks after delivery.,1,1,The researchers are conducting a study that will assess the effectiveness and safety of low molecular weight heparin in women who are at moderate to high risk of VTE after a cesarean section.,
80,NCT00851591,Effect of Fenugreek on Milk Production,"Each year, approximately 3 million mothers in the USA alone leave the hospital breastfeeding an infant. However, a large number discontinue breastfeeding, because milk synthesis is poor or simply stops. Termed Insufficient Milk Syndrome, this condition probably accounts for approximately 5-10% of the total population of breastfeeding mothers and includes many mothers with premature infants, mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome, and a myriad of other unknown causes. The mother's inability to breastfeed causes enormous feelings of inadequacy, grief, depression, and other problems, not to mention increased health risks to the infant.~The most popular herbal remedy used around the world for increasing milk synthesis is fenugreek. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum graecum) is a seed product from the legume family that is commonly sold, since the dried, ripe seed and extracts are used as an artificial flavor for maple syrup. When used orally in amounts commonly found in foods, it has been granted Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the USA by the FDA. Although it is used by millions of women around the world to increase their milk supply, we have only one small case report which suggested it might actually increase the milk supply.~In this one study, the authors found an approximate 40% increase in milk production, although the study was not blinded, nor did they use a control population. For these reasons, we still do not know with certainty if fenugreek works as a galactagogue.~This study is designed to accurately determine if seven days of fenugreek will stimulate milk production in a selected group of subjects with poor milk supply. We hypothesize that the women enrolled in the test group will have increased milk production at the end of the 8-day study.","Inclusion Criteria:~Mothers 2-12 weeks postpartum~Mothers with term infants 37 weeks gestation or older~Mothers with poor milk supply documented by professional lactation consultants~Mothers whose milk supply is less than 600 cc per 24 hours~Mothers who agree not to breastfeed or provide their milk to their infants during this study~Exclusion Criteria:~Mothers with documented mastitis~Mothers with breast engorgement~Mothers with inverted nipples~Maternal BMI greater than 35~Mothers currently consuming Reglan, Domperidone or other drugs/herbals used to induce milk production~Mothers who are clinically ill or hospitalized, or taking the following medications:~Diuretics~Pseudoephedrine~Anticholinergics~Warfarin or any anticoagulant~An estrogen-containing birth control pill~Mothers with Diabetes mellitus~Mothers who have had breast surgery that could alter milk synthesis or production~Mothers diagnosed with Polycystic ovary syndrome~Mothers with tubular breasts or breasts with insufficient glandular tissue~Mothers diagnosed with Asthma or atopic disease~Mothers who are known to be allergic to peanuts or soybeans~Mothers who are pregnant~Mothers whose milk supply per 24 hours exceeds 600 mL~Mothers with Obstetrical evaluation recommending exclusion",Enrolls postpartum,Mothers 2-12 weeks postpartum,1,1,Mothers 2-12 weeks postpartum,

85,NCT04632589,Angiotensin II Receptor Inhibition to Improve Microvascular Function in Women Who Have Had Preeclampsia,"Women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy are more likely to develop and die of cardiovascular disease later in life, even if they are otherwise healthy. The reason why this occurs is unclear but may be related to blood vessel damage and increased inflammation that occurs during the preeclamptic pregnancy and persists postpartum. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the mechanisms contributing to this lasting blood vessel damage and to test whether taking a medication that blocks angiotensin II receptors (losartan) decrease these negative effects in women who have had preeclampsia. Identification of these mechanisms and treatment strategies may lead to better clinical management,of cardiovascular disease risk in these women.~In this study we use the blood vessels in the skin as a representative vascular bed. Using a minimally invasive technique (intradermal microdialysis for the local delivery of pharmaceutical agents) we examine the blood vessels in a nickle-sized area of the skin in women who have had preeclampsia. We make these measurements after the subjects take a placebo and after they take losartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker) to test whether this treatment improves vascular function in these women. As a compliment to these measurements, we also draw blood from the subjects and isolate the inflammatory cells to test how sensitive their inflammatory responses are following the placebo and the losartan treatment.","Inclusion Criteria:~Post-partum women,~18 years or older,~who have delivered within 24 months of the study visit~who have had a preeclamptic pregnancy diagnosed by their obstetrician and confirmed according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria for preeclampsia.

94,NCT02338193,"A Randomized Study Evaluating Dapagliflozin and Metformin, Alone and in Combination, in Overweight Women With a Recent History of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Effects on Anthropometric Measurements and Cardiometabolic Abnormalities","Women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM) are at substantially increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Compared with the general population, these women are more likely to be overweight or obese. Moreover, weight gain after GDM is significantly associated with T2DM, independent of baseline body weight. Weight gain, particularly increased central adiposity after delivery, is strongly associated with deterioration of β-cell compensation for insulin resistance. Taken together, our findings and other studies support increased abdominal fat as the strongest factor associated with declining B-cell compensation for insulin resistance in prior GDM women at high risk for T2DM. Dapagliflozin is a novel highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor that improves glycemic control by reducing renal glucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. Its efficacy and safety has been studied in multiple randomized controlled trials including an add-on to metformin compared with a placebo. To the extent that glucotoxicity contributes to the demise in β-cell function in subjects with impaired glucose, SGLT2 inhibitors also may prove useful in the treatment of prediabetes. An additional secondary benefit of SGLT2 inhibition is the elimination of calories in the form of glucose. The loss of glucose with attendant caloric loss contributes to weight loss; in addition, improvements in β cell function have been seen. Weight loss seen with SGLT2 inhibitors is similar to that seen with glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs, and may be more acceptable because they are oral agents. A consistent finding in all dapagliflozin studies has been a reduction in blood pressure. The investigators hypothesize that combination dapagliflozin -metformin treatment over a 24-week period will have a greater positive impact on body weight, anthropometric measurements and glycemic and cardiometabolic parameters than dapagliflozin or metformin monotherapy in overweight/obese at-risk women with a history of GDM.","Inclusion Criteria:~• Overweight/obese (BMI >25) females 18 years to 45 years of age, who experienced gestational diabetes (GDM) during recent (within 12 months) pregnancy~postpartum metabolic abnormalities determined by a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (Inclusive of prior GDM women with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or both (IFG/IGT) postpartum)~Completed lactation~Using adequate contraception during study period unless sterilized~Written consent for participation in the study~Exclusion Criteria:~Cholestasis during the past pregnancy~Any hepatic diseases in the past (viral hepatitis, toxic hepatic damage, jaundice of unknown etiology), gallstones, abnormal liver function tests or renal impairment (elevated serum creatinine levels or abnormal creatinine clearance~Presence of significant systemic disease, heart problems including congestive heart failure, history of pancreatitis, or diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or 2)~Renal impairment (e.g., serum creatinine levels ≥1.4 mg/dL for women, or eGFR <60)~Significantly elevated triglyceride levels (fasting triglyceride > 400 mg %)~Untreated or poorly controlled hypertension (sitting blood pressure >160/95mm Hg)~Prior history of a malignant disease requiring chemotherapy~Known hypersensitivity or contraindications to use of insulin sensitizers such as metformin or thiazolidinediones~History of hypersensitivity reaction to dapagliflozin or other SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g. anaphylaxis, angioedema, exfoliative skin conditions)~Current use of metformin, thiazolidinediones, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors or weight loss medications (prescription or OTC)~Uncontrolled thyroid disease (documented normal TSH) or hyperprolactinemia~Liver enzymes (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ) levels exceeding more than twice normal lab values~Use of drugs known to exacerbate glucose tolerance~History of diabetes or prior use of medications to treat diabetes except GDM~Currently lactating~Eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia) or gastrointestinal disorders~Suspected pregnancy (documented negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours before first dose of study drug), desiring pregnancy in next 6 months, breastfeeding, or known pregnancy in last 2 months~Active or prior history of substance abuse (smoke or tobacco use within past 3 years) or significant intake of alcohol or history of alcoholism~Patient not willing to use adequate contraception during study period and up to 4 weeks after last dose of study drug (unless sterilized).~Debilitating psychiatric disorder such as psychosis or neurological condition that might confound outcome variables~Inability or refusal to comply with protocol~Not currently participating or having participated in an experimental drug study in previous three months",Enrolls postpartum,"Overweight/obese (BMI >25) females 18 years to 45 years of age, who experienced gestational diabetes (GDM) during recent (within 12 months) pregnancy",1,1,"Overweight/obese (BMI >25) females 18 years to 45 years of age, who experienced gestational diabetes (GDM) during recent (within 12 months) pregnancy~postpartum metabolic abnormalities determined by a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test",

Clinical and epidemiological studies show that women often decrease smoking in pregnancy, when progesterone levels are high. However, at least half resume pre-pregnancy smoking levels within weeks after delivery and when progesterone levels drop.~Data from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that progesterone may be effective in preventing relapse to smoking in non-postpartum women. Prior work has shown that progesterone decreases both craving for cigarettes and the subjective rewarding effects of smoking among recently abstinent female smokers.

This will be a feasibility study that will compare progesterone to placebo for relapse prevention in 40 postpartum smokers.

105,NCT01856907,A Randomized Pilot Study Evaluating Combination Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitor Sitagliptin Plus Metformin Compared to Metformin Monotherapy and Placebo on Metabolic Abnormalities in Women With a Recent History of GDM,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM is one of the most frequent metabolic disorders occurring during pregnancy. Approximately 7% of all pregnancies in the United States are complicated by gestational diabetes resulting in more than 200,000 cases annually. There is epidemiologic evidence associating GDM with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and type 2 diabetes (DM2). Among all the risk factors of diabetes mellitus, the experience of gestational diabetes is the strongest one. Systematic reviews of older studies conclude that 35-60% women with gestational diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes at rates much greater than control groups who did not have glucose intolerance during pregnancy. Studies are needed for optimal postpartum and long-term health of women who have had GDM. Recent evidence suggests that incretin-based therapies may be useful for the treatment of DM2 because continuous administration of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) produces substantial improvements in glucose control and ß-cell function in subjects with DM2. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) increases the concentration of GLP-1 and may potentially delay disease progression in GDM considering the ß-cell function improvement in DM2 and ß-cell mass shown to increase in animal models. This study will examine if combination sitagliptin (a DPP-4 inhibitor)-plus metformin is more effective than metformin alone or placebo in improving metabolic parameters, specifically the impact on β-cell function, in prior GDM women with glucose abnormalities.","Inclusion Criteria:~Females 18 years to 42 years of age who experienced gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during recent (within 12 months) pregnancy with prediabetic hyperglycemia determined by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 75 g glucose postpartum.

110,NCT00487084,Interaction Between Epidural 2-chloroprocaine and Epidural Morphine: Effect of Timing on Efficacy of Morphine Analgesia After 2-chloroprocaine Anesthesia,"Epidural chloroprocaine is often used in obstetrical anesthesia because of its fast onset and short duration. These properties make it an ideal drug to use for epidural anesthesia in patients undergoing postpartum tubal ligation. When epidural morphine is given after chloroprocaine, there is a decreased efficacy of analgesia as compared to lidocaine (1). Several studies have hypothesized a specific opioid receptor mediated antagonism of chloroprocaine (2,3). Karambelkar raised the question whether this decreased efficacy is due to a disparity between the time the chloroprocaine anesthesia resolves and the onset of epidural morphine analgesia, resulting in a time window of pain (2). The duration of action of epidural 2-CP anesthesia is 30-45 minutes and the onset of epidural morphine analgesia is 60-70 minutes, therefore the regression of sensory blockade before the onset of the morphine analgesia could result in a window of pain (2). Hess and colleagues studied epidural morphine analgesia and women who had a Cesarean delivery under spinal bupivacaine anesthesia (3). Subjects were randomized to receive epidural 2-CP and morphine or epidural saline and morphine. There was no difference in postoperative analgesia between the two groups (3 and personal communication, Dr. Philip Hess). A literature search cross referencing epidural chloroprocaine, using Pub Med, did not produce any articles comparing epidural morphine given before the procedure (in an attempt to time the onset of analgesia with the resolution of chloroprocaine anesthesia) to the standard administration time after the procedure.","Inclusion Criteria:~All patients with an epidural catheter in situ for labor analgesia, status post a vaginal delivery, and scheduled for a postpartum tubal ligation under epidural anesthesia will be eligible~Exclusion Criteria:~Allergy/hypersensitivity to morphine~Allergy/hypersensitivity to ester-linked local anesthetics or para-amino benzoic acid (PABA)~Body Mass Index >40 kg/m2~Patients using chronic opioids~History of obstructive sleep apnea~Any contraindication to epidural anesthesia",Enrolls postpartum,"All patients with an epidural catheter in situ for labor analgesia, status post a vaginal delivery, and scheduled for a postpartum tubal ligation under epidural anesthesia will be eligible",1,1,Epidural chloroprocaine is often used in obstetrical anesthesia because of its fast onset and short duration.
