37,NCT03727971,"Use of Omalizumab Will Increase the Pregnancy Rate, Proof of Concept Study, Where Women With Asthma and Infertility Will be Treated Three Times With Weight and IgE Balanced Dosis at the First Day of Their Period Bleeding","The investigators have previously confirmed a clinical hunch that women with asthma have difficulties in becoming pregnant. The investigators found increased time to pregnancy (TTP) in women with asthma compared to non-asthmatic women (55 vs 33 months, p<0.001), furthermore, women with asthma had less successful pregnancies following fertility treatment (39.6 vs 60.4%, p=0.002). Treatment with omalizumab stabilizes the eosinophilic disease, through the systemic and most likely the anti-inflammatory pathways, which indicate a promising possibility to increase pregnancy rate. In a small real-life study in 2017, 5 patients with eosinophilic asthma who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF), were treated with omalizumab prior to embryo transplantation; three out of the five women became pregnant. Lastly, the two remaining patients had several treatments with omalizumab, but did not become pregnant. This real-life study calls for further investigation. By targeting systemic inflammation with omalizumab treatment the aim is to increase asthma control before and during pregnancy. A treatment strategy aiming at improving overall inflammatory control may increase fertility, but also reduce well known maternal and perinatal adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low-birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), preterm delivery.~Study design:~A randomized control trial with omalizumab and placebo, stratified for blood eosinophil count, is therefore needed. A randomized, double blinded, parallel group, study to evaluate the difference between omalizumab (O) and placebo (P) on pregnancy rate in patients with atopic asthma.Treatment schedule: After collection of material (blood samples, sputum) 6th day (±1 day) of the menstrual cycle, the patients will be randomized in either the omalizumab group or the placebo group. No collection of material will be done at the time of enrollment, as this will be on different time of the female cycles. The treatment is initiated with one injection with weight and serum-immunglobulin E balanced omalizumab or one injection placebo. After omalizumab treatment at ovulation it will again be collected material (blood samples, sputum). If no pregnancy has occurred after first IVF cycle, this will be repeated for 3 consecutive IVF cycles in total or until pregnancy has occurred.~Outcome:~The primary out-come is efficacy of omalizumab, compared to placebo, in increasing pregnancy rate in females with asthma. Secondary out-comes are changes in the inflammation in lungs/systemic, pregnancy loss, asthma control and biomarkers in the blood/lungs.","Inclusion Criteria:~* Informed consent~Diagnosis of asthma~Infertility due to male factor infertility, tubal factor infertility or unexplained infertility.~Referred to IVF treatment with or without ICSI~Willingness to receive treatment with biologic drugs during menstruation period~Controlled disease with an ACQ ≤ 1.5~Exclusion criteria:~Other respiratory diseases than asthma~Other inflammatory disease or a disease that affects fertility.~Allergy to the investigational drugs~Respiratory infections requiring antibiotics or anti-viral treatment within 30 days~TESA / TESE, endometriosis~Infertility due to other reasons than male factor, tubal factor or unexplained infertility","asthma~infertility, female",1,"The study aims to increase the pregnancy rate in women with asthma and infertility by using omalizumab treatment.

41,NCT05903131,A Behavioral Intervention to Promote Primary Prevention and Uterine Preservation in Premenopausal Women With Obesity and Endometrial Hyperplasia,"Up to 60% of endometrial cancer cases are attributed to obesity, in part because obesity promotes development of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), and up to 40% of women with AEH go on to develop endometrial cancer. The increasing prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women has resulted in increasing rates of AEH in this age group. Hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries is 100% effective in preventing endometrial cancer, but this approach results in infertility. Fertility-sparing treatments exist, such as treatment with oral or intrauterine progestin, but these treatments do not work uniformly and do not combat the underlying cause of endometrial cancer, which is obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, up to 41% of women on progestin eventually experience relapse of AEH or endometrial cancer. Third, many patients have insulin resistance that may worsen with progestin therapy. Thus, to improve treatment of AEH and grade 1 endometrial cancer, prevent and reverse endometrial cancer, and allow women to preserve their fertility, the investigators must integrate an effective weight loss strategy to be given with progestin treatment. It is the hypothesis that premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer who desire uterine preservation will be more likely to have atypia-free uterine preservation at two years if they receive progestin in combination with a behavioral weight loss intervention versus progestin plus enhanced usual care.","Inclusion Criteria:~Diagnosis of histologically confirmed complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer.~Patients with a previous diagnosis of AEH or grade 1 endometrial cancer who are already being followed with conservative management with oral or LNG-IUD progestin therapy are eligible.~For patients with a previous diagnosis of AEH or grade 1 endometrial cancer who have been placed on progestin prior to study entry, the duration of IUD or oral progestin use prior to trial entry should be less than or equal to 6 months.~Premenopausal woman with a uterus.~ECOG performance status of 0-2.~At least 18 years of age and no more than 45 years of age.~Interested in uterine preservation/fertility-sparing treatment.~BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2.~Prior or current receipt of progestin is allowed as above.

82,NCT06227949,FSH and LH Versus FSH Alone for Ovarian Stimulation in Non-hormone Sensitive Onco-fertility Patients: an Exploratory Randomized Controlled Trial,"Fertility preservation has been performed before the initiation of cancer therapy as cancer therapy is known to be toxic for ovarian function. However, recent studies have shown that ovarian function is reduced in cancer patients even before they start cancer therapy. Reduced ovarian function has been shown by these patients having fewer mature oocytes (female eggs) and lower peak levels of estradiol (a type of estrogen hormone important for fertility). Other studies have shown that in some types of cancers, cancer patients have lower levels of anti-Müllerian hormone, which is a hormone measured to assess how many eggs patient has remaining in the body. Because of these poorer fertility markers shown in cancer patients prior to therapy, some doctors and researchers believe that alternative medications for stimulating ovaries may prove to be beneficial for stimulating the ovaries during fertility preservation.~Currently, luteinizing hormone injections are approved by Health Canada for patients with hypothalamic dysfunction. Hypothalamic dysfunction is a condition whereby lower levels of fertility hormones are produced because of brain dysfunction. Other reasons luteinizing hormone is used in clinical practice is in patients with poor ovarian reserve and patients who are older.~Recent research studies have suggested that some oncology patients may be poor responders prior to cancer therapy because of their underlying disease. The exact reasons for this poor response are not known. However, some researchers believe it may be related to the interactions between the brain and fertility organs, similar to patients with hypothalamic dysfunction. Because of this possible similarity to patients with hypothalamic dysfunction, adding luteinizing hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone (the hormone typically used for ovarian stimulation) may be beneficial for fertility preservation. Studies have also shown improved fertility outcomes with the addition of luteinizing hormone in non-cancer patients who were previously known to be poor responders to ovarian stimulation.~The clinical trial team is aiming to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of luteinizing hormone in non-hormone sensitive cancer patients (patients with cancer other than the breast, ovary or uterus).","Inclusion Criteria:~Between the ages of 18 and 40.~Undergoing IVF for fertility preservation (freezing all oocytes or embryos)~Diagnosed with a non-hormone sensitive malignancy (malignancy other than breast, uterine and ovarian cancer)~GnRH antagonist protocol (standard of care for all fertility preservation patients)~Exclusion Criteria:~Any contraindication to treatment with gonadotropins (including medical history or risk factors for TE, hypersensitivity to gonadotropins or to any of the excipients).~Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism unrelated to the oncological condition.~Previous adverse or allergic reaction to luteinizing hormone or any of its drug components.~Had prior radiotherapy to the abdomen or pelvis~Prior chemotherapy~Prior history of deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism~Patients with a diagnosis of hormone sensitive cancer including ovarian, uterine, or mammary carcinoma~Patients with uncontrolled thyroid or adrenal failure~Patients with active, untreated tumors of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland~Patients who are lactating~Patients with a known diagnosis of primary ovarian failure~Previous participant of this study",fertility preservation,1,"The study involves ovarian stimulation for fertility preservation in cancer patients, specifically through IVF, which is a direct intervention related to promoting fertility and conception.",Undergoing IVF for fertility preservation (freezing all oocytes or embryos),1

Ideally, it has to be taken at the same time everyday and not be forgotten. This may cause higher stress level for some users. Presently on the market, there is a ring-shaped contraceptive device inserted in the vagina at day 1 of the cycle called NuvaRing. The purpose of this device is similar to an oral contraceptive. However, the benefit of NuvaRing is that it can be left in place for a period of up to 35 days without any other manipulation and keep an adequate rate of hormone for contraception. Moreover, NuvaRing shows better hormone stability in the blood. Although the side effects and the benefits are comparable for the two treatments, some studies have shown that more patients would respect the treatment with NuvaRing and that the level of satisfaction would be higher in women using NuvaRing when contraception is needed.~The purpose of the study is to compare the rate of satisfaction as well as the level of stress in women using Marvelon daily or NuvaRing with single insertion in a long protocol.

Two hormones, follicle stimulating hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin (FSH/hCG) will be compared to the standard one hormone, hCG, for the ovulation trigger.~Over the past two decades, the success rate of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has dramatically increased. This increase has largely been attributed to improvements in the laboratory conditions and improvements in ovarian stimulation protocols (those medications used to increase the number of eggs maturing each cycle). Less work has been done on different ways to cause the final maturation of the eggs and the release of the egg from the ovary. The investigators propose to change the final injection prior to the egg retrieval (the ovulation trigger) so that it looks more like what happens in a normal menstrual cycle, where two hormones (both luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH) increase.

214,NCT00778999,"A Randomized, Open-Label Clinical Trial to Identify Predictive Factors for Controlled Ovarian Stimulation Using a Fixed Daily Dose of 200 IU Recombinant FSH in GnRH Antagonist Regimen With or Without Oral Contraceptive Scheduling","The success of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) is critically dependent on optimizing protocols for controlled ovarian stimulation to provide adequate numbers of good quality oocytes and embryos. This optimization is mainly valuable to a group of infertility patients (9%-24%) who respond poorly to Controlled Ovarian Stimulation(COS). It is also important for an additional 2.6% of the infertility patients who manifest a high response to gonadotropin and are at risk for hyperstimulation syndrome, a life-threatening situation. Extensive research was carried out and led to the introduction of GnRH antagonist, as an alternative to Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) agonist, for the prevention of premature Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surges. Further research to optimize the GnRH antagonist regimen concluded that a daily treatment with 200 IU of recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (recFSH) in a GnRH antagonist regimen is safe, well tolerated and results in a good clinical outcome. This protocol is now frequently applied in the US and Europe.~Predicting a woman's response (based on the assessment of ovarian reserve) to COS is useful in determining individualized clinical management strategies for low and high responders and thus avoiding cancellation. Such prediction when based on reliable scientific evidence is valuable in consulting patients about their chances of success. A large number of studies have been performed, which used certain clinical, ultrasonographic and hormonal markers (called predictive factors), to try to optimize a COS protocol for patients who were down-regulated with a long GnRH agonist protocol. Prospective trials of predictive models have also been used to adjust the starting dose of FSH to prevent a too low or too high ovarian response. To date, however, none have been performed for women undergoing ovarian stimulation with a GnRH antagonist protocol.~The primary objective of this randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical trial was to identify one or more factors capable of predicting ovarian response in women treated with a daily dose of 200 IU recFSH in a GnRH antagonist protocol. Since many ART centers now use oral contraceptives as a means to schedule patients stimulated with recFSH and a GnRH antagonist for assisted reproduction, the trial evaluated also whether intervention with oral contraceptives affects the accuracy of predictive models for ovarian response.","Inclusion Criteria:~Females of couples with an indication for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and/or Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) scheduled for their first COS treatment cycle~Females >18 and <=39 years of age at the time of signing informed consent~Body Mass Index (BMI) <= 32 kg/m^2~Normal menstrual cycle length; 24-35 days~Availability of ejaculatory sperm (use of donated and/or cryopreserved sperm is allowed)~Willing and able to sign informed consent~Exclusion Criteria:~History of/or any current endocrine abnormality~Less than 2 ovaries or any other ovarian abnormality (inc.>10mm endometrioma)~Presence of unilateral or bilateral hydrosalpinx~Presence of any clinically relevant pathology affecting the uterine cavity or fibroids >= 5cm~History of recurrent miscarriage (3 or more, even when unexplained)~FSH or LH > 12 IU/L as measured by a local laboratory (sample taken during the early follicular phase: menstrual day 2-5)~Any clinically relevant abnormal laboratory value (FSH, LH, estradiol (E2), Progesterone (P), total Testosterone (T), prolactin, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), blood biochemistry, hematology and urinalysis) based on a sample during the screening phase.~Contraindications for the use of gonadotropins (tumors, pregnancy, lactation, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, hypersensitivity, ovarian cysts)~Contraindications for the use of oral contraceptive pills (history of (h/o) thromboembolism, breast cancer, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding)~Recent history of/or current epilepsy, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, diabetes, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal or pulmonary disease~Abnormal karyotyping of the patient or her partner (if karyotyping is performed)~History or presence of alcohol or drug abuse within 12 months of signing the consent~Use of hormonal preparations within one month prior to randomization~Hypersensitivity to any of the concomitant medication prescribed as part of the treatment regimen in this protocol~Administration of investigational drugs within three months prior to signing the informed consent",infertility,1,"The study focuses on optimizing protocols for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) to improve outcomes in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) for infertility patients.

197,NCT03741699,"A Phase III Multicentre, Randomized, Unblinded Clinical Trial to Test the Effect of Treatment With Recombinant LH Prior to Controlled Ovarian Stimulation in Poor Ovarian Responder Women With an Advanced Maternal Age","Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) is one of the first stages of assisted reproductive treatment. The goal is to mimic the ovarian cycle while stimulating the ovaries to overproduce eggs capable of being fertilized, thus maximizing the chances of reproductive success. The stimulation phase involves the use of different hormonal medications but requires tests to check the development of follicles, and hormonal adjustment to get the optimal ovarian response to stimulation.~However, between 9 to 24% of patients fail to respond adequately to standard stimulation protocols, resulting in Poor Ovarian Response (POR). In addition to the low oocyte production, POR results in a restricted number of good quality embryos with appropriate implantation potential, suggesting a compromised oocyte quality.~POR is one of the most challenging problems in reproductive medicine. Poor responders are difficult to treat since their response to stimulation tend to be deficient even when using different drugs or protocols. In recent years, different therapeutic alternatives have been proposed for these patients. However, to date, the optimal stimulation protocol has not yet been described and oocyte donation is often offered as their only option to achieve pregnancy.~Recently, evidence has emerged that supplementation with a specific hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), during or prior to COS could lead to improved reproductive outcomes in poor responders by increasing the number of oocytes retrieved and improving their quality.~The present study aims to evaluate the effect of the treatment with LH prior to COS on the ovarian response in patients with POR and advanced maternal age, the worst prognosis but more frequent group of poor responders attending fertility clinics. We will assess whether LH treatment prior to COS increases the number and quality of oocytes retrieved in those patients and, finally, analyse the impact in their chances of getting pregnant and having a baby.","Inclusion Criteria:~-Patients with POR according to specific criteria that are in line with the criteria defined by the ESHRE (Bologna Criteria), according to which a patient is classified as a poor ovarian responder when she meets two of the three of the following criteria: I.- Previous episode of POR (≤3 oocytes) with conventional stimulation protocol II.- Abnormal ovarian reserve test with an antral follicle count (AFC) <5-7 and/or anti-mullerian hormone values (AMH) <0.5-1.1 ng/mL.~III.- Women ≥40 years old and/or who have any other risk factor for POR.

3,NCT02738580,Analysis of Follicular Steroid Synthesis During Controlled Ovarian Stimulation With Recombinant FSH vs HMG in GnRH Antagonist Cycles,"Serum concentrations of the different hormones involved in follicular steroid genesis during a cycle of controlled ovarian stimulation with recombinant FSH or HMG will be compared in this study. Serum Progesterone (P) levels at the end of Controlled Ovarian Stimulation (i.e. the day of triggering) have been related to cycle outcome, in terms of ongoing pregnancy and live birth rates. Large cohort studies show that P levels above a certain threshold are associated with poorer cycle outcome. The mechanisms behind P elevation are not well understood yet. It has been shown that P levels are positively related to ovarian response and to the dose of FSH given during COS. Furthermore, it has been well documented that P levels at the end of stimulation are significantly higher when recombinant (r) FSH is used for COS when compared to HMG, either in a GnRH agonist long protocol or in a GnRH antagonist protocol. Some authors suggest that this finding is explained by the fact that COS with rFSH provides a higher oocyte yield than when hMG is given, so the higher P levels observed would be explained by the larger number of follicles developed when rFSH is used. On the other hand, other authors explain this event by a different follicular esteroidogenesis when HMG is used for COS compared to rFSH The hypotheisis behind this assumption is that rFSH enhances P synthesis from its precursor pregnenolone in the granulosa cells. This P is unable to be further metabolized into androgens because of the lack of 17-20 lyase in the human granulosa cells, and therefore is delivered into circulation. On the other hand, when HMG is given for COS, the ∆4 pathway is promoted, and pregnenolone will be catabolized in to Dehidroepiandrostenodione (DHEA), in the theca cells, and this one to Androstenodione, which will be finally aromatized in to estrogens. This mechanism will explain the lower P and higher E2 levels observed in HMG cycles in comparison to rFSH cycles.",Inclusion Criteria:~Good physical and psychological condition~Normal menstrual cycle (25-35 days)~Normal ovarian reserve defined by serum ANH010-30 pMol/L~All other criteria to fulfill by oocyte donors~Exclusion Criteria:~Kidney failure~Ovarian Polyquistic syndrome~Any systemic or metabolic disfunction that counter indicates the use of gonadotrophins~Any other reason that involves exclusion of the oocyte donation program,infertility~controlled ovarian hyperstimulation,1,"The study focuses on controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with recombinant FSH or HMG, which is a key part of assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).

7,NCT01079949,Lutropin Alfa (Luveris®) in Mid Follicular Phase for Controlled Ovarian Stimulation (COS) in Advanced Reproductive Age: Phase II Clinical Trial,"Ovarian reserve is related to chronological age; 35 years of age is the accepted threshold for significant decline in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) success with scarce follicular recruitment and poor oocyte retrieval. New therapeutic schemes are sought to improve follicular response in ovarian ageing because of the increasing number of infertile women aged older than 35 years who are trying to get pregnant. The advent of gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue antagonist (GnRHant) offers new perspectives to address the issues related to advanced reproductive age since it prevents premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surges while not causing suppression in the early follicular phase. Gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue antagonists are administered in the latter stage of the ovarian stimulation to prevent LH surge by competitive blockade of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors, thus producing a marked decrease in LH levels just when the interplay between follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH becomes important to complete follicular development and oocyte competence. Some studies in the past have shown the potential of recombinant human LH (r-hLH) supplementation in women of advanced reproductive age to improve oocyte quality, but these studies are of small size and did not provide data on the physiological mechanism behind the benefit obtained.~This randomized, comparative, parallel controlled Phase II study will be conducted in infertile female subjects aged 35-42 years undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF)/intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), to investigate whether the addition of r-hLH (when the lead follicle is greater than [>] 14 millimeter [mm] in size), to the standard protocol with recombinant human FSH (r-hFSH) under GnRHant, improves the number and quality of oocytes retrieved, implantation rate, and pregnancy rate, while assessing the hormonal milieu in the ovarian follicular fluid.

182,NCT01291056,"Differential Effects of Clomiphene Citrate in Women Undergoing Superovulation: A Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Crossover Study","Clomiphene citrate is commonly used for ovulation induction in women with anovulation, correction of luteal phase deficiency or for superovulation as empiric therapy for unexplained infertility. Superovulation using clomiphene, usually with intrauterine insemination, is usually regarded as first line therapy for unexplained infertility, infertility due to mild endometriosis, or infertility with mild or moderate compromise of the male factor. The side effect profile reported by some women using clomiphene citrate is similar to symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), including tension, irritability, depressed mood, affective lability, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and physical symptoms such as breast tenderness, bloating, headache joint and muscle pain. Few studies have been performed to examine the relationship between clomiphene citrate and mood symptoms; however, these studies have been limited by their small sample size, potential for recall bias and lack of randomization. Moreover, the experience of infertility is dysphoric in and of itself. Therefore, a rigorous evaluation of whether, when in the cycle, and how often clomiphene is associated with mood changes is needed. Such a study would add to the body of literature on this topic in three important ways: 1) use of prospective data collection to more accurately identify commonly reported symptoms, 2) characterize the timing of symptom occurrence relative to treatment cycle, and 3) provide information relevant to planning of future studies involving targeted treatment of clomiphene citrate induced symptoms. If clomiphene use is shown to affect mood, the results would point to an important avenue for psychopharmacologic insight into relationships between mood and sex steroids.~OBJECTIVES:~Specific Aim #1: To identify psychological and physical symptoms experienced by women taking clomiphene citrate for superovulation in a prospective, placebo controlled trial setting.~Specific Aim #2: To determine whether measures of the emotional and physical state prior to the administration of clomiphene, predict the occurrence of mood changes during the five days of clomiphene administration and in the late follicular and luteal phases of the cycle in which clomiphene was administered.","Inclusion Criteria:~Menstruating women, ages 25-40, with regular menstrual cycles 23-35 days in length who elect to treat unexplained infertility using clomiphene citrate for superovulation combined with intrauterine insemination will be eligible for participation in this study.~Eligible participants will be identified by physicians at the Utah Center for Reproductive Medicine at the University of Utah and will be provided written informed consent before being randomized to treatment groups.~Male partner's semen analysis must show a sperm density of at least 10 million per ml, and motility of 20% or greater and normal morphology using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.~Exclusion Criteria:~Women with a history of depression or anxiety disorder requiring hospitalization or treatment lasting more than six months and women who currently or have received treatment during the previous six months for anxiety, depression or other psychiatric disorders listed in the 4th Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) will be excluded.~Women who have previously received treatment with clomiphene citrate will also be excluded from the study.~Women using tobacco or illicit drugs will be excluded from study participation.~Because the measurement tool used to measure symptoms has been validated only in women who can read and speak English, women who cannot speak and read English will not be eligible to participate in the study.",mood,1,"The study investigates the use of clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction and superovulation in women with unexplained infertility, often combined with intrauterine insemination (IUI).

It has been observed that conventional high dose set up regimen of gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is effective in anovulatory subjects in terms of overall pregnancy rates. However, development of multiple follicles leading to multiple pregnancy and/or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is the major complications associated with this high dose set up. Chronic low-dose (CLD) protocols of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), aimed at finding the threshold amount of FSH necessary to promote monofolliculogenesis, have been found to be successful in reducing the rate of OHSS almost to nil and the rate of multiple pregnancies to a minimum. This post-marketing study will investigate tailoring of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (r-FSH) in a large population (N=310) of subjects from a region (North Africa/Middle East) that has not been included in previous studies of ovulation induction in subjects with chronic anovulation.

Although no one knows the cause of the syndrome, scientific studies showed that having too much insulin can be one of the reasons. In fact, almost every overweight woman with PCOS has been found to have high insulin levels.~Recently studies using rats and mice have shown that a commonly used spice, cinnamon, may also reduce the body's insulin level. Another study showed that daily use of cinnamon for forty days lowered the blood sugar level in patients with diabetes.

70,NCT01482286,Effect of Weight and Insulin Sensitivity on Reproductive Function in PCOS,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive disorder in women of reproductive age and despite decades of research the etiology the disorder is not known. The characteristic hyperandrogenism and anovulation is associated with abnormal neuroendocrine function and insulin resistance. Obesity is a common correlated phenotype of Polycystic ovary syndrome and weight gain worsens the reproductive and metabolic complications. Currently there is no evidence-based treatment plan for infertility in Polycystic ovary syndrome; yet weight loss by dietary restriction and regular exercise are strongly advocated.

86,NCT03440359,Supplementation of the Luteal Phase With Vaginal Progesterone (Crinone 8%) in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Undergoing Ovulation Induction With Letrozole: A Prospective and Randomized Controlled Trial,"Aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole are hypothesized to maintain normal hypothalamic/ pituitary feedback mechanisms and in the case of OI (ovulation induction) in women with PCOS, may act to increase follicular sensitivity to FSH by increasing intrafollicular androgen levels. Letrozole also may act to increase midluteal P levels presumably by induction of follicles and corpora lutea. The investigators are asking the question whether P supplementation with Crinone (8%) may have an additive beneficial effect on endometrial development in those women taking letrozole. Progesterone levels in the endometrium (tissue levels) have been documented to be significantly higher than serum levels after vaginal administration which may lead to higher pregnancy rates. In addition P has been shown to decrease LH pulse frequency which is elevated in PCOS and has been shown to down regulate endometrial androgen receptors. There have been retrospective studies showing progesterone supplementation seems to benefit both CC and letrozole treatment groups. In fact, this study showed the only pregnancies in the letrozole group were those in women who took P supplementation. However the number of cycles studied was small. There is a place for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine if luteal phase P supplementation with Crinone should be used in all women using letrozole for Ovulation Induction (OI) in combination with Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) or Timed Intercourse (TI).

To assess the effects of a chronic reduction in circulating insulin on DCI metabolism, we propose to reduce circulating insulin in obese women with PCOS by improving insulin sensitivity with the drug pioglitazone. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that improves peripheral insulin sensitivity, presumably by activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) receptor.

211,NCT03229408,Treating Inflammation in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome to Ameliorate Ovarian Dysfunction,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovaries. Insulin resistance (IR) is a common feature of PCOS, and the resultant hyperinsulinemia is theorized to promote hyperandrogenism in the disorder. However, 30-50% of women with PCOS who are lean do not have insulin resistance. Women with PCOS also exhibit chronic low-grade inflammation. In PCOS, glucose ingestion activates nuclear factor ĸB (NFĸB), the cardinal signal of inflammation culminating in upregulation of the inflammation pathway within mononuclear cells (MNC). This phenomenon is independent of excess adiposity and is highly correlated with circulating androgens. In addition, in vitro exposure to proinflammatory stimuli is capable of directly stimulating ovarian theca cell androgen production. Nonacetylated salicylates suppress NFĸB activation and are well tolerated in humans.~The proposed research is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of 90 women with PCOS. Forty-five subjects with PCOS (15 lean without IR), 15 lean with IR and 15 obese) receiving salsalate, a nonacetylated salicylate, at an oral dose of 3-4 gm daily for 12 weeks will be compared with 45 age- and body-composition-matched control women with PCOS receiving placebo. The overarching hypothesis is that inflammation contributes to ovarian dysfunction, independent of excess adiposity or IR.~The specific aims are, I: To examine the effect of salsalate administration on the ovarian capacity to secrete androgen and on insulin sensitivity in PCOS. II: To examine the effect of salsalate administration on the inflammatory response of mononuclear cells induced by lipid ingestion and glucose infusion in PCOS. The approach involves evaluation of ovarian androgen secretion in response to human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) administration and insulin sensitivity during the euglycemic phase of a two-step pancreatic clamp along with ovulation monitoring before and after salsalate administration. The inflammatory response of MNC to lipid ingestion and the hyperglycemic phase of the two-step clamp will also be evaluated during treatment by measuring reactive oxygen species, the mRNA and protein content of inflammation markers, NFĸB activation and cytokine release in culture.~The investigators expect that women with PCOS receiving salsalate will exhibit decreased ovarian androgen secretion and reduced inflammation regardless of adiposity or IR status. These results will be significant if they show a causal contribution of inflammation to ovarian dysfunction in PCOS, thus improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of PCOS, opening previously unexplored therapeutic avenues that are not necessarily dependent on improving IR, and guiding the design of future studies aimed at determining what interventions will optimally attenuate inflammation in PCOS to reduce medical disease and enhance fertility.","Inclusion Criteria:~Diagnosis of PCOS based on the presence of hyperandrogenism (skin manifestations of androgen excess such as hirsutism, acne or temporal balding - or -elevation of at least one serum androgen [i.e. total testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione or dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate] using predetermined local laboratory cutoffs), oligo/amenorrhea and evidence of withdrawal bleeding after progestin administration.~18-40 years of age.~Good health as evidenced by medical history, physical examination and gynecologic examination within 30 days prior to starting the study.~Willingness to provide informed consent according to the guidelines of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Institutional Review Board (IRB).~Willingness to use double-barrier contraception such as condoms and topical spermicide (foam, cream or gel), condom and diaphragm, diaphragm and topical spermicide or sponge with topical spermicide if sexually active.

89,NCT00719186,A 20 Week Double-Blind Randomized Trial of Clomiphene Citrate and Letrozole for the Treatment of Infertility in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"The primary research hypothesis is that ovulation induction with an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) is more likely to result in live birth than ovulation induction with a selective estrogen receptor modulator (clomiphene citrate) in infertile women with PCOS. A safety hypothesis will also be incorporated into the primary research hypothesis in which we hypothesize both treatments are equally safe for mother and child.~Secondary research hypotheses include:~Treatment with letrozole is more likely to result in singleton pregnancy compared to treatment with clomiphene citrate. Singleton pregnancy is defined as presence of a single intrauterine gestational sac with a single fetal pole and observable heart motion.~Treatment with letrozole will less likely result in a first trimester intrauterine fetal demise than treatment with clomiphene citrate. A first trimester IUFD is defined as a pregnancy that ends before 13 weeks gestation.~Treatment with letrozole is more likely to result in ovulation (increased ovulation rate) compared to treatment with clomiphene citrate. Ovulation is defined as a midluteal progesterone level ≥ 3 ng/mL.~The shortest time to pregnancy will be with letrozole.~Age, body mass index, SHBG, testosterone, LH, Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH), and degree of hirsutism and acne will be significant predictors of ovulation and conception regardless of treatment.~Improvement in SHBG, testosterone, AMH, and LH levels will be significant predictors of ovulation and conception regardless of treatment.~DNA polymorphisms in estrogen action genes will predict response to study drug.~Quality of Life will be better on letrozole than clomiphene.~Letrozole will be more cost effective at achieving singleton pregnancies than clomiphene.","Inclusion Criteria:~Key Inclusion Criteria (Must have ovulatory dysfunction and either hyperandrogenism or PCO)~Chronic anovulation or oligomenorrhea: defined as spontaneous intermenstrual periods of ≥45 days or a total of ≤8 menses per year, or for women with suspected anovulatory bleeding, a midluteal serum progesterone level < 3 ng/mL is indicative of chronic anovulation. For women who have been on ovarian suppressive therapy or other confounding medication (i.e. insulin sensitizing agents) within the last year prior to the study, a history of ≤8 menses per year prior to the initiation of this prior therapy will qualify as evidence of oligomenorrhea. For women with more regular bleeding patterns, but who are suspected to be experiencing anovulatory bleeding, a midluteal progesterone level < 3ng/mL will be evidence of ovulatory dysfunction and qualify as anovulation. Undiagnosed persistent vaginal bleeding should be diagnosed and treated prior to enrollment.~Hyperandrogenism (either Hirsutism or Hyperandrogenemia) or Polycystic Ovaries on Ultrasound:~Hirsutism is determined by a modified Ferriman-Gallwey Score >8 at screening exam (Hatch, Rosenfield et al. 1981 Aug 1). Subjects who have hirsutism do not need local or core labs documenting elevated androgen levels.~Hyperandrogenemia can be determined from local labs. Local cutoffs will be pre-determined by each site prior to study initiation. Hyperandrogenemia will be defined as an elevated total testosterone, or free androgen index (FAI)(in our lab at Penn State College of Medicine a total T > 50 ng/dL or a free androgen index >5) will allow entry into the study (Legro, Driscoll et al. 1998). The FAI is calculated from measurable values for total T and SHBG, as previously described (Miller, Rosner et al. 2004), using the following equation: (FAI = Total testosterone in nmol/L / SHBG in nmol/L) X 100. Outside lab values obtained within the last year documenting elevated T or FAI levels are sufficient to meet criteria of hyperandrogenemia.~Polycystic Ovaries on Ultrasound: We will use the revised Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing polycystic ovaries (Balen, Laven et al. 2003). PCO will be defined as either an ovary that contains 12 or more follicles measuring 2-9 mm in diameter, or an increased ovarian volume (> 10 cm3) on one ovary for entry into the study. If there is a follicle > 10 mm in diameter, the scan should be repeated at a time of ovarian quiescence in order to calculate volume and area if the subject does not otherwise qualify for the study. The presence of a single polycystic ovary (PCO), either by volume or morphology, is sufficient to provide the diagnosis.~Exclusion Criteria:~We will exclude subjects with medical conditions that represent contraindications to CC, aromatase inhibitors and/or pregnancy or who are unable to comply with the study procedures. We will exclude subjects with poorly controlled Type I or Type II diabetes; undiagnosed liver disease or dysfunction (based on serum liver enzyme testing); renal disease or abnormal serum renal function; significant anemia; history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or cerebrovascular accident; uncontrolled hypertension, known symptomatic heart disease; history of or suspected cervical carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, or breast carcinoma; undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, and use of other medications known to affect reproductive function or metabolism (e.g., OCP, GnRH agonists and antagonists, antiandrogens, gonadotropins, anti-obesity drugs, somatostatin, diazoxide, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers). As in PPCOS we will allow a 2 months washout period for subjects who desire to participate and discontinue exclusionary medications (most commonly OCP, but also possibly metformin), and a period of observation or treatment for correctable conditions.~Couple Inclusion Criteria~Sperm concentration of 14 million/mL in at least one ejaculate within the last year, with at least some motile sperm.~Ability to have regular intercourse during the ovulation induction phase of the study.~At least one patent tube and normal uterine cavity as determined by sonohysterogram, hysterosalpingogram, or hysteroscopy/laparoscopy within the last 3 years. An uncomplicated intrauterine non-IVF pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery and postpartum course resulting in live birth within the last three years will also serve as sufficient evidence of a patent tube and normal uterine cavity as long as the subject did not have, during the pregnancy or subsequently, risk factors for Asherman's syndrome or tubal disease or other disorder leading to an increased suspicion for intrauterine abnormality or tubal occlusion.~No previous sterilization procedures (vasectomy, tubal ligation) that have been reversed. The prior procedure may affect study outcomes.~Specific Exclusion Criteria~Current pregnancy.~Patients on oral contraceptives, depo-progestins, or hormonal implants (including Implanon). A two month washout period will be required prior to screening for patients on these agents. Longer washouts may be necessary for certain depot contraceptive forms or implants, especially where the implants are still in place. A one-month washout will be required for patients on oral cyclic progestins.~Patients with hyperprolactinemia (defined as two prolactin levels at least one week apart > 30 ng/mL or as determined by local normative values). The goal of eliminating patients with documented hyperprolactinemia is to decrease the heterogeneity of the PCOS population. These patients may be candidates for ovulation induction with alternate regimens (dopamine agonists). A normal level within the last year or on treatment is adequate for entry.~Patients with known 21-hydroxylase deficiency or other enzyme deficiency leading to the phenotype of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. 21-hydroxylase deficiency will be excluded in all patients by a fasting 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) level <2 ng/mL (Azziz, Hincapie et al. 1999 Nov). If relevant, this level should be determined in the follicular phase, because the 17-hydroxyprogesterone level is likely to be elevated beyond this range if the patient is in the luteal phase of an infrequent ovulatory cycle. In the case of elevated fasting 17-OHP levels in the follicular phase, an ACTH stimulation test will be performed. A 1-hour stimulated value > 10 ng/mL will be an exclusion (Moran, Knochenhauer et al. 1998). As 21-hydroxylase deficiency is a congenital condition, any normal level in the past of 17-hydroxyprogesterone allows entry into this study.~Patients with menopausal levels of FSH (> 15 mIU/mL). A normal level within the last year is adequate for entry.~Patients with uncorrected thyroid disease (defined as TSH < 0.2 mIU/mL or >5.5 mIU/mL). A normal level within the last year is adequate for entry.~Patients diagnosed with Type I or Type II diabetes who are poorly controlled (defined as a glycohemoglobin level > 7.0%), or patients receiving antidiabetic medications such as insulin, thiazolidinediones, acarbose, or sulfonylureas likely to confound the effects of study medication; patients currently receiving metformin XR for a diagnosis of Type I or Type II diabetes or for PCOS are also specifically excluded.~Patients with liver disease defined as AST or ALT > 2 times normal or total bilirubin >2.5 mg/dL.~Patients with renal disease defined as BUN > 30 mg/dL or serum creatinine> 1.4 mg/dL.~Patients with significant anemia (Hemoglobin < 10 g/dL).~Patients with a history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or cerebrovascular accident.~Patients with known heart disease that is likely to be exacerbated by pregnancy.~Patients with a history of, or suspected cervical carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, or breast carcinoma. A normal Pap smear result within ACOG guidelines for Pap smear frequency will be required for women 21 and over.~Patients with a current history of alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse is defined as > 14 drinks/week or binge drinking.~Patients enrolled simultaneously into other investigative studies that require medications, proscribe the study medications, limit intercourse, or otherwise prevent compliance with the protocol. Patients who anticipate taking longer than a one month break during the protocol should not be enrolled.~Patients taking other medications known to affect reproductive function or metabolism. These medications include oral contraceptives, GnRH agonists and antagonists, antiandrogens, gonadotropins, anti-obesity drugs, anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin and thiazolidinediones, somatostatin, diazoxide, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The washout period on all these medications will be two months and a list is found in the appendix.~Patients with a suspected adrenal or ovarian tumor secreting androgens.~Patients with suspected Cushing's syndrome.~Couples with previous sterilization procedures (vasectomy, tubal ligation) which have been reversed. The prior procedure may affect study outcomes, and patients with both a reversed sterilization procedure and PCOS are rare enough that exclusion should not adversely affect recruitment.~Subjects who have undergone a bariatric surgery procedure in the recent past (<12 months) and are in a period of acute weight loss or have been advised against pregnancy by their bariatric surgeon.~Patients with untreated poorly controlled hypertension defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg or a diastolic ≥ 100 mm Hg obtained on two measures obtained at least 60 minutes apart.",pregnancy~polycystic ovary syndrome,1,"The study focuses on ovulation induction treatments (clomiphene citrate and letrozole) for infertile women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), aiming to improve conception rates and live births.
