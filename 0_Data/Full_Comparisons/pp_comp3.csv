"12","NCT01943565","Intrathecal Hydromorphone for Post-cesarean Delivery Pain - a Dose Finding Study","Pain relief after cesarean delivery can be provided in a few ways. Most commonly, certain medications called opioids, such as morphine, are given through the vein or into the muscle. However, a more effective way to give pain relief with fewer side effects (such as nausea and slowing your breathing) is to give opioids in the spinal space as part of the medications given for a cesarean delivery.~For many years, the opioid of choice was morphine due to its long anesthetic effect and acceptable side effect profile. A nation-wide disruption in the supply of preservative-free morphine has made it necessary to look for alternatives. Many institutions worldwide have used another opioid, called hydromorphone, in the spinal space for over a decade. This drug has a very good safety and side effect profile and has been used at the investigators' institution for more than a year. Of interest, while a number of different doses of hydromorphone have been used, there have been very few studies to evaluate the best dose for providing good pain relief with minimal side effects.

"20","NCT02922985","Multimodal Pain Management for Cesarean Delivery: A Randomized Control Trial","Opioid use and abuse has become a major medical problem in the United States. Over prescription of opioid medications is a major contributor to this growing problem. Cesarean delivery (CD) is the most commonly performed surgery in the US and women are generally given opioid medications for postoperative pain management. This is not a common practice in other developed countries. We believe that a multimodal pain management strategy is superior to current practices for control of postoperative pain after CD and will lead to a decrease in the use of opioid medications. This will have beneficial effects on patients' recovery and bonding with their newborns, as well as societal effects in reducing the burden of opioid abuse in the US. Our objective is to investigate the use of a multimodal pain regimen in pregnant patients undergoing CD. This is a randomized double-blinded, placebo controlled trial. The multimodal intervention consists of a pre-operative dose of IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev), infiltration of subcutaneous bupivacaine prior to skin incision, and a dose of IM ketorolac at time of fascial closure. These study medications are currently used in our patient population but not in a standardized fashion, not in every patient, and not always in combination with each other. The control group will receive placebo IV infusion preoperatively and an IM injection at fascial closure, and subcutaneous infiltration with normal saline before skin incision. Both groups will receive spinal regional anesthesia as per anesthesia team and then postoperatively, both groups will receive the current standard of care, which consists postoperative hydrocodone/acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed depending on pain score. Our primary outcome of interest will be the total opioid intake in the first 48 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes include time to first opioid given, pain scores at 6-12, 24 and 48 hours post op, and total number of opioid tablets left after discharge on post op day number 7. We will also evaluate patient satisfaction scores and total length of hospital stay. We will evaluate neonatal outcomes including Apgar scores, cord blood gases, immediate newborn complications in the first 48 hours after birth, and any infant adverse outcomes related to maternal opioid use up to 4 weeks of life.

"35","NCT00458003","Phenylephrine Versus Ephedrine to Treat Spinal Anesthesia-Induced Hypotension in Preeclamptic Patients During Cesarean Delivery","Hypotension remains a common clinical problem after induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Maternal hypotension has been associated with considerable morbidity (maternal nausea and vomiting and fetal/neonatal acidemia). Traditionally, ephedrine has been the vasopressor of choice because of concerns about phenylephrine's potential adverse effect on uterine blood flow. This practice was based on animal studies which showed that ephedrine maintained cardiac output and uterine blood flow, while direct acting vasoconstrictors, e.g., phenylephrine, decreased uteroplacental perfusion. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that phenylephrine has similar efficacy to ephedrine for preventing and treating hypotension and may be associated with a lower incidence of fetal acidosis. All of these studies have been performed in healthy patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery.~Preeclampsia complicates 5-6% of all pregnancies and is a significant contributor to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Many preeclamptic patients require cesarean delivery of the infant. These patients often have uteroplacental insufficiency. Given the potential for significant hypotension after spinal anesthesia and its effect on an already compromised fetus, prevention of (relative) hypotension in preeclamptic patients is important. Spinal anesthesia in preeclamptic patients has been shown to have no adverse neonatal outcomes as compared to epidural anesthesia when hypotension is treated adequately. Due to problems related to management of the difficult airway and coagulopathy, both of which are more common in preeclamptic women, spinal anesthesia may be the preferred regional anesthesia technique. Recent studies have demonstrated that preeclamptic patients may experience less hypotension after spinal anesthesia than their healthy counterparts. To our knowledge, phenylephrine for the treatment of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension has not been studied in women with preeclampsia. The aim of our study is to compare intravenous infusion regimens of phenylephrine versus ephedrine for the treatment of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension in preeclamptic patients undergoing cesarean delivery. The primary outcome variable is umbilical artery pH.","Inclusion Criteria:~ASA PS II - III women~18 years old and older~scheduled for cesarean delivery (no trial of labor)~eligible for spinal anesthesia~diagnosis of preeclampsia~Exclusion Criteria:~patients with failed trial of labor~preexisting hypertension~body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m2~resting heart rate < 60 bpm~progression to eclampsia, > twin gestation~known fetal anomalies~contraindications to spinal anesthesia~emergency procedure or refusal of consent~failure to achieve a T6 level of anesthesia~conversion to general anesthesia",1,"Neither","0",0,0,"Hypotension remains a common clinical problem after induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery."

The investigators will compare two different approaches to injecting the local anesthetic in this space. Conventionally, the block is done after surgery is completed and the abdomen is closed. The anesthesiologist introduces a needle through the abdominal wall skin under ultrasound guidance to reach the TAP space and the drug is injected. Since the TAP layer is one of the deeper layers of the abdominal (belly) wall and is closer to the inside of the abdomen than to the outside (skin), injecting from the inner aspect of the abdominal wall during the surgery is easier and quicker to perform than the conventional block and does not require ultrasound guidance as there is no risk of injury to abdominal organs like the liver.~With this research the investigators attempt to prove that surgically administered TAP blocks take 25% less time to perform compared to the conventionally administered TAP block for post cesarean section pain relief. Surgical TAP blocks are also more cost-effective as in addition to reduced OR time, they are safer and do not require skilled operator and specialized equipment.

Medication is injected in the neurofascial plane between the internal oblique and the tranversus abdominis muscle.~Previous studies have demonstrated limited (<24 hour) effect of the block when compared to the use of intrathecal morphine (considered to be the gold standard for postoperative analgesia). In a study by McMarrow et al., post-caesarian pain control combinations including TAP blocks with local anesthetic (Bupivacaine) or saline after a spinal anesthetic with or without intrathecal morphine were compared.~At 6 hours the Morphine consumption was slightly reduced in the patients that received both intrathecal morphine and TAP blocks with LA when compared to patients that received spinal saline and TAP with saline. At 24 hours the TAP block conferred no benefit in terms of opioid consumption. Similarly, the study by Lee et al. demonstrated better pain scores for the first 2 hours in patients receiving both intrathecal morphine and a TAP block with ropivacaine. At 24 hours there was no difference in the pain scores for patients that received both intrathecal morphine and TAP blocks.~On the contrary, a more recent study utilizing liposomal bupivacaine has been utilized for TAP blocks for post cesarean delivery analgesia, demonstrating opioid reductions for up to 72 hours. Liposomal bupivacaine is a novel, multivesicular formulation designed for rapid absorption, prolonged release of bupivacaine, and analgesia following a single intra-operative administration into the surgical wound or for TAP blocks.~Current anesthesia practices encourage the use of multimodal analgesia that aim at enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS).

Spinally-administered morphine provides 16-24 hours of high quality pain relief. The dose administered is usually 75-200 micrograms, but surprisingly few dose-response studies exist.~The mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1 gene)is the site of action of endogenous opioid peptides and opioid analgesic drugs like morphine. There is a common genetic variant of this receptor at the 40th amino acid of the protein, with asparagine and asparate being present in different people. The less common variant (aspartate), present in 25-30% of the overall American population (higher in Asian populations, lower in Blacks) at codon 40 that has been shown in many studies to affect opioid analgesia.~This will be a randomized, blinded study of 3 doses of spinal morphine (50, 100, 150 micrograms) given to women undergoing elective cesarean section at term pregnancy. 300 women will be studied (100 per dose).

"64","NCT04612920","Towards Enhanced Recovery After Cesarean: Scheduled Post-operative Medication: a Randomized Controlled Trial","One in 300 women will become persistent opioid users after cesarean delivery (1). Cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure in the United States, representing 31.9% of the 3,788,235 deliveries in 2018 (2). Patients have to cope with the pain and challenges of post-operative care while adjusting to motherhood and completing activities of daily living. Often when they return home, they are also tasked with other domestic roles which compounds the challenge of this post-operative period. With a potential impact just in the US on 1.2 million mothers each year, optimizing post-operative pain management in order to reduce the risk of persistent opioid use represents an urgent unmet public health goal. To this end, there are national efforts to reduce the cesarean rate and optimize post-cesarean pain management (3,4). The majority of efforts in the last few years have focused on home-going medications and alterations in prescription practices. Recent recommendations from the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society indicate that patients should receive multi-modal analgesia on a regular basis, along with early post-delivery mobilization (3). However, the efficacy of scheduled non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAID) along with acetaminophen in the immediate post-operative period and after going home have not been systematically studied in the cesarean population. We hypothesize that patients who receive scheduled medications in the post-operative period are less likely to require opioids for pain relief both in the hospital and after they return home.","Inclusion Criteria:~Undergoing repeat cesarean delivery~≥37 week gestation~attended at least 7 prenatal visits~age ≥18.~Exclusion Criteria:~Non-English speaking, attended < 7 prenatal visits, fetal anomalies or death, inability to ambulate, BMI ≥45kg/m2 at delivery due to higher risk of regional analgesia complications, placental implantation abnormalities, maternal diabetes due to the risk of wound complications, chorioamnionitis, allergy to study medications, underlying renal or hepatic impairment, opioid use in the last 3 months, chronic controlled substance use, chronic pain disorders, history of narcotic addiction, intraoperative hemorrhage not controlled with medication alone, additional concurrent surgeries other than sterilization procedures and presence of endometriosis noted at time of surgery.

However, spinal opioids are associated with a wide variety of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, (N/V) and pruritus (itching). The occurrence of pruritus can vary between 30% and 100% making pruritus the most common side-effect of intrathecal opioids and this rate is even higher in pregnant patients. Pruritus may require treatment which can be ineffective or sometimes reverse the analgesic effect of the opioids. Ondansetron is a safe and very commonly used Serotonin receptor antagonist treatment for local anesthetic opioid-induced pruritus used in pregnancy. The effect of different administration times of ondansetron in reducing pruritus or N/V in cesarean section (CS) cases has not been extensively studied and thus, this prospective study can help guide future clinical management of side effects caused by spinal intrathecal morphine administration.","Inclusion Criteria:~American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1-3~Adult parturient (18 -50 years of age) scheduled to undergo elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia~Patients must be willing and cognitively able to give written informed study consent~Exclusion Criteria:~Patients with an ASA physiological assessment greater than grade 3~Allergies to local anesthetics, opioids, or ondansetron~Coagulopathies precluding provision of spinal anesthesia~Pre-eclampsia with severe features~Eclampsia~Pre-intrathecal pruritus~Psychiatric or language deficiencies affecting assessment of pain~Insufficient understanding of the pain scoring system~Patients who receive any other regional anesthesia techniques~Patients on higher than a 100mg of daily morphine equivalent~Cardiac issues that would preclude spinal anesthesia (Congestive heart failure, Mitral or Aortic valve pathology.~Confounding neural issues that would preclude spinal anesthesia.~Coadministration of drugs that would potentially interact with ondansetron.

"71","NCT00486902","Does a Single Intravenous Dose of Ketamine Reduce the Need for Supplemental Opioids in Post-Cesarean Section Patients?","Pain control after cesarean delivery is associated with improved breastfeeding and infant rooming-in times. In addition, inadequate analgesia leads to elevated plasma catecholamine concentrations, which negatively affect every organ system. There is growing evidence that ketamine, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, is efficacious when used as an adjuvant in postoperative pain control. A 2006 Cochrane Collaboration systemic review and meta-analysis concluded, Ketamine in subanesthetic doses….is effective in reducing morphine requirements in the first 24 hours after surgery.~Ketamine's prolonged analgesic effect, despite its short half-life and its use in low doses, is theorized to be due to blockade of spinal cord central sensitization. Central sensitization is a phenomenon whereby repeated painful stimulus leads to more severe pain perception over time despite no change in the intensity of the painful stimulus.Ketamine may also prevent the development of acute opioid tolerance. Ketamine's analgesic effects have also demonstrated in the obstetric population. Post-cesarean delivery morphine requirements in women who received ketamine as part of a general anesthesia technique were decreased. Similary, low-dose ketamine in conjunction with bupivacaine-only spinal anesthesia reduced postoperative analgesic requirements compared to bupivacaine-only spinal anesthesia and bupivacaine-fentanyl spinal anesthesia.~In the United States, healthy women scheduled for elective cesarean delivery commonly receive spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine-fentanyl-morphine. To our knowledge, IV ketamine has not been studied as an adjuvant to this regimen in the analgesic management in post-cesarean delivery patients. Multimodal therapy for postoperative pain control is widely practiced due to the advantage it provides in blocking multiple pain pathways while minimizing side effects of each individual pain medication. We hypothesize that low dose intravenous ketamine will improve multi-modal post-cesarean analgesia compared to placebo.
