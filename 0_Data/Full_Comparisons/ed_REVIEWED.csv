107,NCT00244023,"Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Randomized Study of Co-Administering Testosterone With PDE5 Inhibitors in Patients Non-Responders to PDE5 Inhibitors Alone","30 to 50% of the patients presenting with Erectile Dysfunction (ED) do not respond to PDE V Inhibitor therapy, which is presently considered as the first choice treatment for most ED patients. Recent reports stated a high prevalence of low serum testosterone levels in such non responders, and an improvement of their response by combining testosterone therapy with the PDE V Inhibitor. This suggests there may be a minimum threshold level of blood testosterone for a full effectiveness of PDE V Inhibitor therapy. Two double blind, placebo controlled studies have added support to this hypothesis but one involved only 20 patients while in the other the benefit of combining testosterone was transient. This is a multi-centric study, double blind placebo controlled and randomized as concerns testosterone administration, that aims to objectively assess the efficacy of co-administering testosterone with the PDE 5 inhibitor Tadalafil to improve the erectile function of a large group of ED patients non-responders to PDE V inhibitors alone. Patients will be screened to ensure inclusion and exclusion criteria completion, including a serum testosterone level < 4 ng/ml for total testosterone or < 1 ng/ ml for bioavailable testosterone. They will then enter a four week run-in period in the meanwhile they will receive Tadalafil 10 mg only, once daily, in order to confirm their non responsiveness to PDE V inhibitors and their eligibility to enter the treatment phase based on IIEF scoring, SEP diaries and a Global Assessment Question (GAQ). The patients still non responders after 4 weeks of Tadalafil 10 mg daily will enter a 12 weeks treatment phase including visits at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16. Treatment procedure will include: 1. continuation of Tadalafil at 10 mg dose daily followed by routine assessment using SEP diaries, IIEF scoring, GAQ and Aging Male Symptoms scale administered at each study visit. Safety assessments will be performed in addition during the last visit (physical examination including DRE, PSA and BCC). 2.

75,NCT00955929,A Randomized Trial of Pharmacological Penile Rehabilitation in the Preservation of Erectile Function Following Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy,"When a bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP) is performed, recovery of erectile function (rigid erections) is reported for up to 80% of patients, who are less than 60 years old. Erectile function recovery is also impacted by patient age, erectile function before surgery, and the length of time after surgery.~Current evidence from studies suggests that developing erections is important, however, these studies have been small, and the evidence is not definite. Animal studies suggest that erection medication (Viagra, Levitra, Cialis) may protect erection tissue, even in the absence of erections. However, the correct treatment plan is unknown. For example, how often does a man need to take sildenafil (Viagra®) to protect his erectile function or to maximize his erectile function recovery? Is only using erection medication enough for erectile function recovery? Would penile injections, which almost ensure production of an erection, be better than using sildenafil (Viagra®), or might a combination be even better at helping recovery of erections? These are types of questions this study might answer.","Inclusion Criteria:~Male, must be ≥ 18 years of age, with histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma, that is clinically localized to the prostate gland~Stable sexual relationship for ≥ 6 months~Open or laparoscopic bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy~Baseline score of ≥ 22 on the International Index of Erectile Function Domain (Appendix A)~Able to speak, read and write in the English language~Calculated creatinine clearance using the 4 variable MDRD equation based on serum creatinine, age, race, and gender of > 60 cc/min~Patient is able to walk up two flights of stairs briskly without chest pain~Patient needs to have their baseline sitting AND standing blood pressure and pulse done at the time of consent~Exclusion Criteria:~Preoperative or planned postoperative pelvic radiation therapy~Preoperative or planned postoperative androgen deprivation~Presence of Peyronie's disease at baseline~Presence of a penile prosthesis at baseline~Resection of one or both nerve bundles at surgery~Any contraindications to sildenafil:~Patient is currently using nitrates;~Presence of retinitis pigmentosa;~Presence macular degeneration;~MI or CVA within 3 months;~Patient is currently using MAOI medications~Patient is currently using penile self injection medication (Trimix, Bimix, or PGE-1)~Patient requiring sildenafil for penetration~Use of sildenafil within 30 days of consent",penile cancer~erectile dysfunction~radical prostatectomy,1,"The trial is focused on the preservation and recovery of erectile function following a bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.
