"NCT04720456 Noninvasive Subharmonic Aided Pressure Estimation of Portal Hypertension in Children Early diagnosis of portal hypertension is difficult as symptoms rarely manifest until the later stages of liver disease. Both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension can result in life-threatening complications, the most frequent of which is bleeding from esophageal varices. In children, variceal bleeds are associated with mortality rates of 1-3 %, while life-threatening complications have been reported in up to 20 % of children with cirrhosis. Despite the high incidence of portal hypertension in children with liver disease, a noninvasive modality to monitor disease progression and risk of complications is currently lacking. Hence, this trial will investigate the safety and efficacy of subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) as a noninvasive ultrasound technique for diagnosing portal hypertension in children.

"NCT01280669 Sirolimus as a Therapeutic Approach for Uveitis: A Phase 2, Open-label, Randomized Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Bioactivity of Two Doses of Intravitreal Injection of Sirolimus in Patients With Non-infectious Uveitis The purpose of this study is to find out about the safety and effectiveness of two different doses the study drug, sirolimus, administered intravitreally in patients with uveitis. The potential effectiveness of sirolimus can be utilized to control inflammation in uveitis and yet avoid the potential complications that are usually associated with the systemic use of the drug and other immunomodulatory therapies. In this study, the investigators will administer sirolimus inside the eye (intravitreally) in one of two doses (440mcg/mcL or 880mcg/mcL). Local administration of sirolimus to the eye is not expected to have effects on the rest of the body. Therefore, it may offer a safer way than the current methods used to control the inflammation caused by non-infectious uveitis. All 18 Years N/A Inclusion Criteria:~Males and females greater than or equal to 12 years of age.~Able to give informed consent and attend all study visits.~Have diagnosis of uveitis determined by the Investigator to be non-infectious based on the patient's medical history, history of present illness, ocular examination, review of systems, physical examination, and any pertinent laboratory evaluations.~Meet the following criteria:~Have active uveitis, defined as having at least 1+ Vitreous Haze and/or at least 1+ Vitreous Cell Count (SUN scale), and:~are receiving no treatment; or~are receiving:~prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day (or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid), or~at least 1 systemic immunosuppressant other than corticosteroids, or~combination of prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day (or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid) and other systemic immunosuppressant.~Have inactive disease, defined as having 0.5+ Vitreous Haze or less and 0.5+ or less Vitreous Cell Count (SUN scale), and:~are receiving:~prednisone <10 mg/day (or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid), or~at least 1 systemic immunosuppressant other than corticosteroids, or~combination of prednisone <10 mg/day (or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid) and other systemic immunosuppressant.~Have posterior, intermediate, or panuveitis; for panuveitis, if an anterior component is present, it must be less than the posterior component.~Sufficient inflammation to require systemic treatment and, based on the Investigator's decision, warrants intravitreal treatment.~Best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity of 20/400 or better (approximately 20 letters) in the study eye.~Best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity of 20/400 or better in the fellow eye (approximately 20 letters).~Exclusion Criteria:~Patients with bilateral uveitis who are receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, or azathioprine) other than prednisone or other corticosteroids for the treatment of uveitis and the uveitis in the fellow eye, in the opinion of the Investigator, cannot be controlled with standard local therapies alone;~Any significant ocular disease that could compromise the visual outcome in the study eye.~Intravitreal injections (including but not limited to anti-vascular endothelial growth factors 60 days prior to the baseline;~Posterior subtenon's or intravitreal injection of steroids 90 days prior to Baseline;~Intraocular surgery within 90 days prior to Day 0 in the study eye;~Capsulotomy within 30 days prior to Day 0 in the study eye;~History of vitreoretinal surgery or scleral buckling within 90 days prior to Day 0 in the study eye;~Any ocular surgery (including cataract extraction or capsulotomy) of the study eye anticipated within the first 180 days following Day 0;~Intraocular pressure ≥25 mmHg in the study eye (glaucoma patients maintained on no more than 2 topical medications with IOP <25 mmHg are allowed to participate);~Pupillary dilation inadequate for quality fundus photography in the study eye;~Media opacity that would limit clinical visualization, intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA), or OCT evaluation in the study eye;~Presence of any form of ocular malignancy in the study eye, including choroidal melanoma;~History of herpetic infection in the study eye or adnexa;~Presence of known active or inactive toxoplasmosis in either eye;~Ocular or periocular infection in either eye;~Participation in other investigational drug or device clinical trials within 30 days prior to Day 0, or planning to participate in other investigational drug or device clinical trials within 180 days following Day 0.

Sham Block, In Reducing Postoperative Pain And Opioid Consumption In Patients Undergoing Elective Primary Posterior Cervical Spine Fusion Surgery (CSFS) The goal of this randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial is to assess the benefit of administering a Multifidus Cervicis Plane (MCP) block compared to a sham block as a method of postoperative pain control in patients undergoing posterior cervical spine fusion surgery. The main question it aims to answer is if the MCP block group will have reduced maximum pain scores during the first 24 postoperative hours compared to the sham block group.~Participants will receive preoperative bilateral MCP blocks on the back of their neck using the standard of care local anesthetic solution that consists of 30 mLs 0.25% Bupivacaine + 0.5 mL (5 mg) preservative-free Dexamethasone + 0.1 mL Epinephrine (MCP block group). Researchers will compare the MCP block to the preoperative sham block which consists of injecting 3 mL of normal saline into the same area (Sham block group) to compare the postoperative pain scores between the groups as a main objective. The secondary objectives are:~Postoperative opioid consumption during hospitalization and at 2 weeks after discharge.~The amount and type of non-opioid analgesics used during hospitalization.~The occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and the use of antiemetics.~Hospital and Post Anesthesia Care Unit length of stay (LOS).~Monitor the safety of the study interventions during hospitalization and readmissions within 30 days of discharge.~Patient satisfaction with pain management and overall satisfaction with the surgery experience.

"NCT01690520 Multi-Center, Open-Label Randomized Study of Single or Double Myeloablative Cord Blood Transplantation With or Without Infusion of Off-The-Shelf Ex Vivo Expanded Cryopreserved Cord Blood Progenitor Cells in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies This randomized phase II trial studies how well donor umbilical cord blood transplant with or without ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor umbilical cord blood transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's cells. When the healthy stem cells and ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It is not yet known whether giving donor umbilical cord blood transplant plus ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells is more effective than giving a donor umbilical cord blood transplant alone.

"NCT01686932 Multicentric Cross-over Trial to Assess the Glycemic Profiles on 8 Weeks of Vildagliptin and Sitagliptin Treatment, Each, in Type-2 Diabetic Patients With a Pre-existing Cardiovascular Disease Pre-treated With Insulin, Using a PROBE-design Vildagliptin and Sitagliptin both belong to the class of DPP-4 inhibitors, but differ in their pharmacokinetic profile as well as in their approved application (Vildagliptin, 2x 50 mg daily, Sitagliptin, 1x 100 mg daily). This leads to distinct results regarding postprandial blood-glucose normalization as well as protective properties regarding hypoglycemic episodes - especially during the night. Additionally, in type 1 diabetic patients a correlation has been described between hypoglycemia and abnormal heart function (QTc-elongation), which can have severe consequences for the patients. This study aims for the evaluation of the potency of both drugs to prevent and/or reduce hypoglycemic events in insulin-dependent type-2 diabetics and furthermore to evaluate the correlation of hypoglycemic episodes with changes in heart-function measured by Holter-ECG.~The hypothesis is tested, if vildagliptin leads to a more favourable glycemic profile than sitagliptin and is more potent in protecting from nocturnal abnormalities in heart-function caused by undetected hypoglycemic episodes.

"NCT01810354 PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS PRIOR TO CESAREAN SECTION IN OBESE WOMEN: Does Increasing the Dose Increase the Tissue Concentration? Surgical site infections are common and a cause of major morbidity. They are also more common in obese women. Cesarean sections are the most common surgery performed in the United States, therefore pregnant women are being faced with this problem frequently. There is evidence to show that prophylactically administered antibiotics, cefazolin specifically, to obese women prior to cesarean section do not reach adequate concentrations in adipose tissue to prevent infection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if an increased dose of cefazolin will attain adequate tissue concentration in obese women. Our hypothesis is that three grams of cefazolin given no more than 60 minutes prior to the start of a cesarean section in an obese (Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30) woman will attain adequate adipose tissue concentration compared to two grams of cefazolin.~Subjects will be selected if they are greater than 37 weeks gestation wiht a singleton pregnancy and require a cesarean section for any obstetrical indication. Women will be excluded if they have a suspected infection, have a multiple gestation, or have preexisting diabetes or hypertension with end organ damage. The subjects will be screened both by through the OR schedule as well as through the clinics. They will then be consented and enrolled by the primary investigator. Once enrolled the subjects will be randomized to receive either two grams or three grams of cefazolin as prophylactic antibiotics to be given no more than 60 minutes prior to the start of the surgery.~Two adipose tissue samples will be obtained at the time of surgery. The first at the start after skin incision and the second at the end prior to closure of the skin. There will also be a separate IV placed at the start of the procedure from which three blood draws can be collected. These three samples will be obtained at the start of the surgery but after antibiotic administration, at the time of the first adipose collection, and at the time of the second adipose collection. The samples will then be stored at -80 degrees and shipped to David P. Nicolau's lab in Hartford, CT for the tissue and serum analysis.~While the subjects are in the hospital recovering from their surgery, a chart review will be performed to determine if there are any infections occuring post-operatively. A telephone survey will be conducted six to eight weeks postpartum again assessing for any infectious complications after the cesarean section. Female N/A N/A Inclusion Criteria:~Obese - body mass index (BMI) calculated as weight (kg)/ [height (m2)]greater than or equal to 30 as determined at their first prenatal visit~Gestational age of 37 0/7 weeks and greater~Singleton Pregnancy~Non-emergent cesarean section~Exclusion Criteria:~Known cephalosporin allergy~Severe allergy to penicillin making cephalosporin use a contraindication~Exposure to antibiotics in the preceding 7 days~Need for emergent cesarean section~Multiple gestations~Suspected chorioamnionitis~Pre-gestational diabetes~Chronic hypertension with evidence of end organ damage infection prevention"

"NCT01721655 Determining the Effect of Spironolactone on Electrolyte Supplementation in Preterm Infants With Chronic Lung Disease Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), also known as chronic lung disease (CLD), is a major complication of premature birth and is associated with a significant increased risk of complications including death. Diuretics have been used for decades in babies with BPD and are considered a standard of care. Patients receive electrolyte supplementation to replace the electrolytes removed by the diuretics. Spironolactone is not as good as other diuretics at removing extra fluid, but it is different from chlorothiazide and furosemide because instead of removing potassium, it actually can increase potassium levels in our body. Spironolactone is used with chlorothiazide to try to minimize the potassium lost; therefore, reduce the electrolyte supplementation needed. However, studies have suggested that preterm babies aren´t developed enough to appropriately respond to spironolactone. Also, one study has shown that adding spironolactone to chlorothiazide in patients with BPD has no effect on whether or not patients receive electrolyte supplementation. This study will examine whether there is a difference in the amount of electrolyte supplementation between patients receiving chlorothiazide only or chlorothiazide plus spironolactone. the investigators hypothesize there will be no difference in the amount of electrolyte supplementation between the two groups. All N/A N/A Inclusion Criteria:~The attending makes the decision to start enteral chlorothiazide for long-term diuretic therapy.~Gestational age < 32 weeks at time of delivery~If patient is currently receiving furosemide and electrolyte supplements, these must be discontinued prior to enrollment.~Exclusion Criteria:~Renal anomaly~Receiving maintenance IV fluids for more than the previous 48 hours~Any contraindication to receiving enteral medication~Serum Na < 132 mEq/L~Serum K < 3.0 mEq/L~Serum Cl < 92 mEq/L~Presence of ostomy of any sort chronic lung disease~bronchopulmonary dysplasia"

"NCT01904500 Peri-operative Cefazolin Prophylaxis at Time of Cesarean Delivery in the Obese Gravida Obesity has become an increasingly prevalent public health problem in the United States, reaching epidemic proportions. According to 2009 CDC epidemiologic data on obesity in the United States, 35.7% of the United States population is considered overweight or obese. Currently, on the review of the literature, over 20% of pregnancies in this country are complicated by maternal obesity. Obesity has been well demonstrated to be correlated with numerous adverse pregnancy outcomes such hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and increased rates of operative delivery. Moreover, obesity, irrespective of pregnancy, has been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for the development of postoperative surgical site infections. Development of such infections can have both consequential long-term medical sequelae for patients and economic impacts on the health care system at large. Cefazolin, a first generation hydrophilic cephalosporin whose clearance is exclusively mediated via the kidneys unchanged, is used as pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis for cesarean deliveries. The current accepted standard of care is to administer 2 grams of cefazolin within 60 minutes of skin incision. Studies of drug concentrations of cephalosporins for pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis in obese bariatric patients have shown that therapeutic concentrations may not be achieved in both tissue and plasma. Limited data exist in pregnancy. Therefore, it is the goal of this study to investigate whether obese patients presenting for cesarean delivery require an increased dosing amount of pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. This study will randomized women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or more who are presenting for their scheduled cesarean delivery to receive either 2 grams or 3 grams of cefazolin for pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. By drawing blood at specific time points in the peri-operative period and extracting adipose tissue samples during cesarean delivery, this study will investigate the pharmacokinetics of cefazolin in both the plasma and tissues of the obese gravida.

"NCT05256225 A Phase II/III Study of Paclitaxel/Carboplatin Alone or Combined With Either Trastuzumab and Hyaluronidase-oysk (HERCEPTIN HYLECTA) or Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and Hyaluronidase-zzxf (PHESGO) in HER2 Positive, Stage I-IV Endometrial Serous Carcinoma or Carcinosarcoma This phase II/III trial tests whether adding trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk (Herceptin HylectaTM) or pertuzumab, trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-zzxf (PhesgoTM) to the usual chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) works to shrink tumors in patients with HER2 positive endometrial serous carcinoma or carcinosarcoma. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies and forms of targeted therapy that attach to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab or pertuzumab attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Hyaluronidase is an endoglycosidase. It helps to keep pertuzumab and trastuzumab in the body longer, so that these medications will have a greater effect. Hyaluronidase also allows trastuzumab and trastuzumab/pertuzumab to be given by injection under the skin and shortens their administration time compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab alone. Paclitaxel is a taxane and in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Giving Herceptin Hylecta or Phesgo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin may shrink the tumor and prevent the cancer from coming back in patients with HER2 positive endometrial serous carcinoma or carcinosarcoma.

"NCT03739268 GLP-1-mediated Gluco-metabolic Effects of Bile Acid Sequestration The objective of this study is to investigate the potential GLP-1-mediated contribution to the well-established glucose-lowering effect of sevelamer-induced bile acid sequestration . Exendin9-39 has been demonstrated to act as a potent and specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist with no partial agonistic potential and is considered a useful tool in the assessment of GLP-1 physiology. The aim is to evaluate any contribution of sevelamer-induced GLP-1 secretion to the reduced plasma glucose concentrations observed after treatment with sevelamer. A randomised placebo-controlled cross-over study involving two 17-day treatment periods with sevelamer and placebo, respectively, in metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, will be conducted. The impact of bile acid sequestration on GLP-1 secretion and effect will be examined during two randomised experimental days after 15 and 17 days of treatment with sevelamer (1,600 mg three times a day) and placebo, respectively. During each of these two experimental days, a meal test with concomitant exendin9-39 infusion or placebo will be performed (for evaluation of any GLP-1-mediated effects). Postprandial plasma glucose excursion is the primary endpoint, and secondary endpoints include postprandial plasma/serum excursions of insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, glucagon, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), peptide YY (PYY), oxyntomodulin, ghrelin, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-19, FGF-21, C4 (an intermediate in the de novo synthesis of bile acids), cholecystokinin (CCK), bile acids and plasma lipids.

"NCT00811057 Tocolysis for Preterm Labor Preterm birth is the most common and costly complication in obstetrics. It complicates up to 11% of all pregnancies and it is responsible for 70% of sick babies. The ideal way to stop preterm labor when it occurs (which drug to use) is not known. Currently magnesium sulfate is used by about 95% of all practitioners, but recent data suggest magnesium given this way may be harmful for the baby's future development. Other drugs such as antiprostaglandin agents are very effective in stopping uterine activity, but particularly when used for >48 hours have been associated with both maternal and fetal sides effects. Lastly, calcium channel antagonists are effective in stopping contractions and have very little in the way of maternal and fetal side effects, but less data is available in the United States on their use. Because there is no FDA approved drug to stop preterm labor, we purpose to randomize all women with preterm labor (20-34 weeks) to receive one of the above three methods of stopping preterm labor. The primary outcomes will be to see which agent stops the uterine contractions most effectively, for the longest period of time with fewest relapses and results in significant prolongation of pregnancy. If one of these agents is clearly superior to the other two it would help women avoid early delivery or have significant extension of their pregnancy to avoid some of the complications of preterm birth in the baby.

"NCT01251315 PILOT: The Effects of Short Term Administration of a Novel Glutathione Precursor (FT061452), on Serum and Intracellular Glutathione Levels Glutathione is a powerful protective substance found within every cell in the body. It has been shown that glutathione levels go down as a person gets older, which makes a person more likely to get heart disease, high blood sugar problems and different kind of cancers. N-Acetyl Cysteine is used as a dietary supplement. It has been reported to increase glutathione levels in the body. The diet supplement called ProImmune is also changed by the body into glutathione. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find out the effect of ProImmune in healthy people. This study will also help to prove whether or not the ProImmune is able to improve the blood levels of glutathione in healthy people.

"NCT01109498 A Study to Determine the Safety and Efficacy in Lipoprotein Lipase-Deficient Subjects After Intramuscular Administration of AMT-011, an Adeno-Associated Viral Vector Expressing Human Lipoprotein LipaseS447X LPLD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by the presence of marked chylomicronemia and hence hypertriglyceridemia. Clinically the most severe manifestation of chylomicronemia, is acute pancreatitis, which can be lethal. There is no effective therapy available to modulate the course of the illness and prevent complications for these patients. The current clinical management consists of severe reduction of dietary fat that is hard if not almost impossible to comply with. LPLD subjects continue to experience pancreatitis attacks, and are admitted to intensive care units on several occasions.~Alipogene tiparvovec corrects or restores lipoprotein lipase (LPL) function long term, and hence reverses some symptoms, halts the disease progression and prevents further complications. Alipogene tiparvovec gene therapy ensures that a catabolically beneficial variant of the human LPL gene, LPL[S447X] is expressed and active in the relevant tissues in humans. Delivery of the gene is realized via intramuscular injection of an adeno-associated viral vector, pseudotyped with AAV1 capsids.

"NCT00858832 Reduction of Endometritis After Cesarean Section With the Routine Use of Methergine Endomyometritis is an infection in the uterus. It can occur in up to 1 out of 5 women having unplanned cesarean deliveries. Antibiotics are routinely given at the time of Cesarean delivery, but the infection in the uterus can still occur. When endomyometritis occurs it can prolong the woman's stay in the hospital after birth, slow down her recovery time at home, and increase medical costs. Methergine is a medication that is routinely used to stop uterine hemorrhage (excessive bleeding from the uterus) that sometimes happens after delivery. Methergine works by contracting (tightening) the uterus. These contractions also help the uterus to expel or remove parts of the placenta that increase the chance of developing a uterine infection.~This research study is being done to learn if routine use of Methergine can lower the chances of developing a uterine infection after cesarean delivery. Half of the women in this study will receive Methergine for a few days during their hospitalization after cesarean delivery. The other half of the women will not routinely receive Methergine.

"NCT03935828 Effect of Topical Sinonasal Antibiotics in Post-Surgical Patients With an Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Rhinosinusitis In this study, patients who have had previous endoscopic sinus surgery and present with an acute exacerbation of chronic rhinosinusitis will be offered endoscopic-guided, culture-directed antibiotic therapy. They will then be randomized to receive oral or intranasal topical antibiotics. Both of these are considered standard of care, but there is some limited data suggesting superiority of topical antibiotics especially if guided by culture and in patients who have undergone previous surgery. However, a study that directly compares the two has not been published. Modified Lund-Kennedy endoscopic finding scores and subjective SNOT-22 questionnaires will be collected before and at 3-4 weeks after treatment. Medication-related sided effects will be noted and analyzed. After 6-8 month follow-up, we will analyze the rate of recurrence of exacerbations, need for further antibiotics, need for revision surgery, and SNOT-22 scores based on oral versus topical antibiotic treatment. Our objective is to evaluate both short and long-term response to both oral and topical administration of antibiotics in this patient population in order to determine if either route of administration is superior to the other.

This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. All 18 Years 60 Years Inclusion Criteria:~Mild to moderate hypertension. For purposes of this study, the investigators define mild to moderate hypertension as being on no more than 1-2 antihypertensive medications and blood pressure &lt;140 mm Hg systolic and &lt;90 mm Hg diastolic based on mean seated blood pressure at the screening visit in our clinic. For these visits, the investigators measure blood pressure using a Dinamap automatic oscillometric cuff while subjects are seated quietly. The subjects are left in a quiet room without speaking for 5 minutes initially. The Dinamap is started and the technician leaves the room and 3 blood pressures are obtained at intervals of 2 minutes.

"NCT05422534 Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the Response to Exercise in Patients With Advance Kidney Disease Frailty and sarcopenia are modifiable risk factors for morbidity and mortality in patients with ESRD. Exercise is the recommended intervention to prevent frailty and sarcopenia, however, many clinical trials have shown limited clinical improvement in muscle mass and physical function. We propose that mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the deterrents to the effectiveness of the exercise. We plan to evaluate the additive effect of HIIT and CoQ10, a mitochondrial-targeted therapy, on mitochondrial function and physical performance. Understanding the interplay among CoQ10, exercise, and mitochondrial function will identify novel mechanisms to improve the efficiency of exercise. This will also serve to prevent frailty, sarcopenia, and muscle dysfunction in patients with ESRD.

"NCT04783051 Comparison of IST Using Ultra-sensitive Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test and Pyronaridine - Artesunate - PYRAMAX®) to Standard IPT Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to Prevent Malaria in Pregnant Women Living in Endemic Areas In endemic settings Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) can sequester in the placenta resulting in low peripheral parasitemia and false negative malaria diagnosis in pregnant women. Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnant women with Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is one of the World Health Organization's recommended malaria control strategies in sub-Saharan African countries. The strategy overcomes the risk of misdiagnosis of malaria in pregnant women by treating them all with SP according to predetermined schedules, but the strategy is now threatened by the spread of Plasmodium parasite resistant strains. As a necessary alternative, Intermittent Screening and Treatment in pregnancy (ISTp), aims on the monthly screening of pregnant women with a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and the treatment of positive cases with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) regardless of the presence of symptoms. The ISTp depends on the performance of the diagnostic tests, and the use of ultrasensitive RDTs (us-RDTs), which have a higher analytical sensitivity than conventional RDTs, should improve the efficacy of the strategy.~Unlike IPTp-SP, ISTp prevents overuse of antimalarials and thus limits drug pressure on malaria parasites. This advantage could be potentiated by using, for pregnant women, an ACT that is not yet used or should not be used in the field for other strata of the population. The recently approved new ACT combination, Pyronaridine - Artesunate (Pyramax®) is the ideal candidate for this purpose.~This study will compare the effects of the ISTp using an us-RDT and Pyramax® (ISTp-US-Py) with the standard IPTp-SP on maternal malaria indicators (malaria infection, parasite density), maternal anemia, spontaneous abortions or intrauterine deaths during pregnancy, fetal morbidity (preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age) and neonatal mortality at delivery in both study groups through conducting a randomized clinical trial enrolling second trimester pregnant women in Maternité Esengo Health Center, located in Kisenso, Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a malaria perennial transmission area.~The results generated from this study will be essential for the National Malaria Control Program in the selection and implementation of new malaria control policies and addresses the effectiveness of IPTp-SP decline among pregnant women in the DRC.

"NCT03893630 Role of Aspirin in Maternal Endothelial Dysfunction and Uterine Artery Blood Flow in Women at Risk for Preeclampsia Endothelial dysfunction and defective placental vascularization are hypothesized to be significant causes of preeclampsia. In preeclampsia, due to vascular endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction and platelet activation can result in severe features which alter pregnancy outcomes. However, studies have shown that acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) can decrease endothelial dysfunction leading to decreased platelet aggregation which reduces adverse outcomes. The objective of our study is to determine if Aspirin has a dose-dependent response for modifying biomarkers reflective of maternal endothelial dysfunction when indicated for preeclampsia prevention in a cohort of women identified at risk for developing preeclampsia.~Pregnant women who are at risk for preeclampsia will be randomized to receive either 81mg Aspirin or 162mg Aspirin daily starting from 11-16 weeks of gestation until 36 weeks of gestation. A third, control group of women at low risk for preeclampsia will not receive aspirin.

"NCT03958123 Evaluation of the Effects of Multiple Therapeutic and Supratherapeutic Doses of Cebranopadol on Cardiac Repolarization in Healthy Subjects The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of cebranopadol (GRT6005) on the electrical activity of the heart in healthy participants.~The study consisted of a screening period within 21 days before the first dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP) (between Day -25 and Day -4) during which informed consent was obtained and the general suitability of the participants for the trial was assessed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.~Participants were confined to the trial site from 4 days before first IMP dosing on Day 1 to 4 days after last IMP dosing on Day 30. During this period, multiple-doses of cebranopadol or matching placebo and a single-dose of moxifloxacin or matching placebo were administered. Moxifloxacin was used as a positive control. It has consistently shown that it has an effect on the heart rhythm. Continuous 12-lead ECGs were recorded at defined time points.

"NCT01912651 The Role of Antibiotics in Full Thickness Skin Graft Survival for Facial Reconstructive Surgery Antibiotics are sometimes prescribed to patients who have had reconstructive surgery of wounds on their face using skin grafts. But, it is not yet known whether antibiotics improve the healing of skin grafts and reduce the risk of infections after surgery in these patients. It is known that antibiotics, like all medications, have side-effects although these are rare. This research study is designed to show us whether antibiotics improve wound healing or not, so that we may determine if we should continue using antibiotics even if they have side-effects in some patients.~Our hypothesis is that patients treated with post-operative, systemic antibiotics will demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the survival of their facial full thickness skin grafts compared to patients who are not treated with systemic antibiotics.

"NCT00946088 Progesterone for Maintenance Tocolysis: A Randomized Placebo Controlled Trial Preterm delivery is the most common cause of infant morbidity and mortality in the United States. Some women have episodes of preterm labor during their pregnancy which can be temporarily stopped. These women, however, are at high risk for delivering before term. At this time, we do not have sufficient evidence to use any medication to help prevent these women from delivering early. Recently, preliminary studies have shown that progesterone may help prevent some women at high risk for preterm delivery from delivering early. Our study will investigate whether progesterone can help this specific group of women, women with arrested preterm labor, deliver healthy infants at term.

"NCT02003625 Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (Meloxicam) to Mobilize Hematopoietic Stem Cells: A Phase II Randomized Trial This research study is evaluating a drug called meloxicam to see if it provides a benefit to people receiving Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT).~The participant is currently scheduled to receive an AHSCT, which is a procedure that removes blood-forming stem cells (cells from which all blood cells develop) from the body. These stem cells are stored and later given back to the participant by a process called apheresis. This is a standard procedure to treat certain blood diseases such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma. However the use of meloxicam with this procedure is considered investigational.~Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is given to decrease fever, swelling and pain that may come with inflammation. It has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of arthritis however it has not been approved for use in people receiving AHSCT.~This study will compare the combination of meloxicam with a drug called G-CSF (also called neupogen), to the combination of G-CSF with an agent that has no medicine (placebo). G-CSF is a substance that causes blood stem cells to change or increase in number when given to people undergoing AHSCT. The researchers would like to learn if giving meloxicam in combination with G-CSF to people before they undergo AHSCT will increase the number of stem cells available in the blood to collect and make the collection process easier. All 18 Years 75 Years Inclusion Criteria:~Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to participate in the study:~Patients with hematologic malignancies for whom autologous stem cell transplantation is deemed clinically appropriate. Patients participating in this study are patients who are going for their first attempt at stem cell mobilization.~Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or Hodgkin's lymphoma: refractory/relapsed but chemosensitive disease. Patients with CR or PR will be eligible for this protocol.~The designation of PR requires all of the following:~At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according to all of the following: they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body; and they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.~No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.~Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥ 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the greatest transverse diameter.~With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually assessable and no measurable disease should be present.~Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was positive before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified (eg, large-cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a CR by the above criteria, but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered partial responders. Multiple myeloma in first or second remission. Patients with CR or VGPR will be eligible for this protocol.

"NCT00903344 Impact of Vitamin D Supplementation on Lactation Associated Bone Loss Studies have shown that lactation is associated with a loss of bone density from four to seven percent at the spine and hip among women who lactate for six months. Decline in bone density with lactation occurs rapidly. Although bone density increases after weaning, there is controversy on whether or not it is completely restored. Epidemiological studies find no significant negative impact of lactation on bone mass or fractures, and in fact there is evidence that lactation has a positive effect on bone mass. We think that interventions that attenuate this physiologic loss of bone that is associated with lactation and accelerate restoration of bone mass after weaning may result in improved long term bone mass and diminished fracture risk.

"NCT02922985 Multimodal Pain Management for Cesarean Delivery: A Randomized Control Trial Opioid use and abuse has become a major medical problem in the United States. Over prescription of opioid medications is a major contributor to this growing problem. Cesarean delivery (CD) is the most commonly performed surgery in the US and women are generally given opioid medications for postoperative pain management. This is not a common practice in other developed countries. We believe that a multimodal pain management strategy is superior to current practices for control of postoperative pain after CD and will lead to a decrease in the use of opioid medications. This will have beneficial effects on patients' recovery and bonding with their newborns, as well as societal effects in reducing the burden of opioid abuse in the US. Our objective is to investigate the use of a multimodal pain regimen in pregnant patients undergoing CD. This is a randomized double-blinded, placebo controlled trial. The multimodal intervention consists of a pre-operative dose of IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev), infiltration of subcutaneous bupivacaine prior to skin incision, and a dose of IM ketorolac at time of fascial closure. These study medications are currently used in our patient population but not in a standardized fashion, not in every patient, and not always in combination with each other. The control group will receive placebo IV infusion preoperatively and an IM injection at fascial closure, and subcutaneous infiltration with normal saline before skin incision. Both groups will receive spinal regional anesthesia as per anesthesia team and then postoperatively, both groups will receive the current standard of care, which consists postoperative hydrocodone/acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed depending on pain score. Our primary outcome of interest will be the total opioid intake in the first 48 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes include time to first opioid given, pain scores at 6-12, 24 and 48 hours post op, and total number of opioid tablets left after discharge on post op day number 7. We will also evaluate patient satisfaction scores and total length of hospital stay. We will evaluate neonatal outcomes including Apgar scores, cord blood gases, immediate newborn complications in the first 48 hours after birth, and any infant adverse outcomes related to maternal opioid use up to 4 weeks of life. Our hypothesis is that our multimodal pain regimen will decrease the total opioid requirement in the first 48 hours after surgery. Female 18 Years 45 Years Inclusion Criteria:~Women who are 18 - 45 years of age at the time of cesarean delivery with the ability to give informed consent~Elective cesarean delivery~Gestational age ≥ 34 weeks~Fluent in either English or Spanish~Spinal anesthesia~Exclusion Criteria:~Urgent or emergent CD~Epidural or combined spinal epidural regional anesthesia~General anesthesia~Patients with a contraindication for regional anesthesia~Acute or chronic hepatic disease~Acute or chronic renal disease~Active asthma~Gastrointestinal ulceration~Inflammatory bowel disease~Allergy to ketorolac, acetaminophen, hydrocodone, codeine, ibuprofen or bupivacaine~Opioid dependence~Non reassuring fetal or maternal status requiring immediate delivery~Placenta previa or accreta~Acute or chronic pain disorder~Maternal weight <50 kilograms~Uncontrolled hypertension~Ischemic cardiac disease~Congestive heart failure~Thrombocytopenia, platelet count <150,000/microliter~Preeclampsia including Hemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelets syndrome~Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or active hemorrhage before randomization~Estimated blood loss > 2000 mL pain"

"NCT03079921 Adrenergic Contribution to Glucose Counterregulation in Islet Transplantation To determine the effect of sympathetic neural and hormonal (epinephrine) input on islet cell hormonal responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic recipients of intrahepatic islet transplantation. We hypothesize that α-adrenergic (neural) blockage will abolish insulin-mediated suppression of C-peptide, attenuating α-cell glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia, and that β-adrenergic (hormonal) blockage will have no effect. Glucose counterregulatory responses will be measured during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamps on three occasions with randomized, double-blind administration of the α-adrenergic blocker phentolamine, the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol, or placebo. The demonstration of neural rather than hormonal regulation of the transplanted islet cell response to hypoglycemia is critical for understanding the mechanism for protection from hypoglycemia afforded by intrahepatically transplanted.

"NCT04160000 A Phase 4, Randomized, Open Label, Multicenter Prospective Comparative Study To Evaluate The Treatment Of Atrial Fibrillation In Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure Heart failure (HF) with preserved left ventricular function (pEF) is difficult clinical syndrome to treat effectively with few evidence based therapies. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is now an important co-morbidity being observed in 43% of patients with HFpEF. Rhythm control has not been studied in this population. Catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs are rhythm control therapies that have been used for treatment of AF without HF or HF with reduced systolic function but have not been widely applied in HFpEF. No controlled comparative evaluation has been performed in HFpEF.~The introduction of wireless pulmonary artery hemodynamic monitoring has permitted optimization of HF therapy in patients with chronic HF with reduced and preserved EF. Reduction in HF hospitalizations has been observed in post hoc analyses of HFpEF patients but has not been systematically applied in AF patients with HFpEF.~In this study, we propose to study both rhythm control and optimized HF therapeutic approaches in an AF with HFpEF study population in a pilot study using a sequential two phase randomized controlled clinical trial design.

"NCT00003088 A Randomized Phase III Trial of Sequential Chemotherapy Using Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel, and Cyclophosphamide or Concurrent Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide Followed by Paclitaxel at 14 or 21 Day Intervals in Women With Node Positive Stage II/IIIA Breast Cancer RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving drugs at different times or combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective for breast cancer.~PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy consisting of either doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, or paclitaxel given at different times with that of combination chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel in treating women with stage II or stage IIIA breast cancer. Female 18 Years N/A Required Tumor Parameters~1.1 Patients with operable, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the female breast and positive lymph nodes. Node positivity may be determined by either an axillary node dissection or a positive sentinel node finding by immunohistochemistry or histology. This includes any patient with one or more positive lymph nodes whose tumors are T0, T1, 2 or 3 and N1, N2, MO. Patients with metaplastic carcinoma are eligible. Bilateral disease does not exclude patients from entry.~1.2 Tumors that are locally advanced at diagnosis are not eligible. This is left to investigator judgment. Patients with tumors fixed to the chest wall, peau d'orange skin changes, skin ulcerations, or clinical inflammatory changes (T4 disease) are excluded from this study. Dermal lymphatic involvement noted on pathology without clinical inflammatory changes will not exclude a patient from this study.~1.3 Patients with any ERP/PgR status are eligible.~Prior treatment:~2.1 <84 days from mastectomy or within 84 days of axillary dissection if the patient's most extensive breast surgery was a breast sparing procedure.~2.2 Surgical resection margins - All tumor should be removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy. Node dissection: patients may have had either an axillary node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy before beginning treatment on protocol.~Mastectomy: There should be no evidence of gross or microscopic tumor at the surgical resection margins noted in the final surgery or pathology reports for patients who have had a modified radical mastectomy. Patients with close margins (tumor < 1 mm from margin) are eligible.~Segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy): Although clear margins are preferable, DCIS or LCIS at the surgical resection margin will not render a patient who has undergone a segmental mastectomy ineligible for this study. Invasive tumor at the final resection margin will render a patient ineligible.~2.3 No prior chemotherapy.~2.4 No prior radiation therapy for this malignancy. Patients who received radiation to the breast for DCIS are eligible. Patients who have had segmental mastectomy will be treated with radiotherapy according to standard procedures in the treating physician's institution after completion of all chemotherapy.

"NCT00275158 Effect of L-Arginine Therapy on the Glomerular Injury of Pre-Eclampsia: A Randomized Controlled Trial Pre-eclampsia complicates 7 - 10% of pregnancies and constitutes a leading cause of fetal growth retardation and premature birth, as well as infant and maternal morbidity and mortality. The kidney is the primary site of injury resulting in high blood pressure, loss of protein into the urine and decreased kidney function. The release of vasoconstrictors over vasodilators from an abnormal placenta may underlie pre-eclampsia. Nitric Oxide (NO) is an important vasodilator that is thought to play an important role in the kidneys ability to accommodate to a healthy pregnancy. Normal pregnancy in the rat is accompanied by increased production of NO and its second messenger cGMP. There is a parallel increase in renal expression of constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme that generates NO from arginine. In the pregnant rat, an infusion of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an exogenous inhibitor of NOS, has been shown to replicate some of the hemodynamic features of the syndrome of pre-eclampsia. In a recent animal study, L-arginine supplementation reversed the adverse effects of L-NAME on pregnancy by attenuating the high blood pressure and by significantly decreasing protein loss in the urine. To date, studies of the use of L-arginine supplementation to treat women with pre-eclampsia have been small or uncontrolled and have only assessed blood pressure as a primary outcome measure. We report a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of L-arginine supplementation for the treatment of pre-eclampsia, in which precise physiological techniques have been utilized to assess kidney dysfunction in addition to blood pressure. Female 18 Years N/A Inclusion Criteria:~- Women selected for the study were diagnosed with pre-eclampsia in the second half of pregnancy.~i.) an elevation of blood pressure to levels in excess of 140 systolic over 90 diastolic ii.) proteinuria determined by a urine dipstick value ≥ 2+, or quantitated at ≥ 0.5 g either per gram of creatinine or in a 24 hour urine collection.~Exclusion Criteria:~Women with a history of underlying renal disease defined as a pre-pregnancy azotemia (serum creatinine ≥ 1.2 mg/dl) or proteinuria pre-eclampsia"

"NCT04158713 Chemoprevention With Monthly IPTp With Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for Malaria in HIV-infected Pregnant Participants on Daily Cotrimoxazole in Kenya and Malawi: a Multi-centre Placebo-controlled Trial 2.3.3 Short technical protocol summary Background: Pregnant women represent a vulnerable population for malaria. HIV-infected women are particularly at risk. In HIV-infected pregnant women, WHO recommends daily cotrimoxazole (CTX), an antifolate drug, for malaria chemoprevention and prophylaxis against opportunistic infection. However, there is cross-resistance with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and high levels of antifolate resistance threatens the antimalarial effect of CTX. Recent trials with intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) with mefloquine in HIV-infected women on daily CTX, suggested that chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial markedly improves the protection against malaria compared to daily CTX alone. However, mefloquine was not well tolerated.~The long-acting combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is well tolerated and has shown great promise as IPTp in HIV-negative women in East-Africa. Chemoprevention with monthly DP has also been explored in HIV-infected pregnant women on daily CTX in Uganda. Unfortunately, the study was inconclusive because malaria transmission was too low and a clinically relevant drug interaction with efavirenz (EFV) was found reducing the exposure to DP. WHO now recommends dolutegravir (DTG) based combination antiretroviral therapy (ARTs) as the preferred firstline regimen including for pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. As a result, many countries in Africa are now transitioning to DTG-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cARTs). No such drug-drug interaction is expected between DTG and DP. We will, therefore, assess the safety and efficacy of malaria chemoprevention with monthly DP in HIV-infected women on daily CTX and DTG-based cARTs.~Objectives and methods: This is a 2-arm, individually-randomized, multi-centre, placebo-controlled superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of daily CTX plus monthly DP ('CTX-DP') versus daily CTX plus monthly placebo-DP (i.e. 'CTX-alone', control arm) to reduce malaria and the adverse effects of malaria in 898 (449 per arm) HIV-infected pregnant women on DTG-based cARTs. The study will be conducted in 8 hospitals in Kenya and Malawi in high SP-resistance areas with a high prevalence of malaria. These are the same sites where the sister trial in HIV-uninfected women is being conducted in Kenya and Malawi (IMPROVE trial). Both the mother and baby will be followed for 6-8 weeks after delivery. The study is powered at 80% (alpha=0.05) to detect ≥50% relative risk reduction (RR=0.50) in the primary outcome (cumulative incidence of malaria infection) from 12% in the CTX-alone arm (control arm) to 6% in in the interventions arm allowing for 20% non-contributors. The trial includes a pharmacokinetic assessment, cardiac monitoring for safety, assessment of antimalarial drug and the impact on immune responses to malaria and other pathogens.

"NCT00135707 A Randomized Clinical Trial of Antioxidants to Prevent Preeclampsia and An Observational Cohort Study to Predict Preeclampsia Preeclampsia is one of the most common complications of pregnancy and is characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine. This can cause problems in the second half of pregnancy for both the mother and fetus. This study of preeclampsia consists of two parts: 1) a randomized, placebo controlled, multicenter clinical trial of 10,000 low-risk nulliparous women between 9 and 16 weeks gestation and 2) an observational, cohort study of 4,000 patients between 9 and 12 weeks gestation who are also enrolled in the trial.~Subjects in both parts will receive either 1000 mg of vitamin C and 400 IU of vitamin E or matching placebo daily. The purpose of the randomized, clinical trial is to find out if high doses of vitamin C and E will reduce the risk of preeclampsia and other problems associated with the disease. The study will also evaluate the safety of antioxidant therapy for mother and infant. Patients will be seen monthly to receive their supply of study drug, to have weight and blood pressure recorded, to have urine protein measured, and to assess any side effects. At two visits, blood and urine will be collected.~The observational, cohort study will prospectively measure potential biochemical and biophysical markers that might predict preeclampsia. These patients will have additional procedures including uterine artery Doppler and blood drawn for a complete blood count (CBC).

The Phase Ib included three arms. Three different methods of administration and two different BYL719 formulations were studied to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of BYL719 in combination with cetuximab:~Arm A - film-coated whole tablets were orally administered to patients who were able to swallow the tablets; Arm B - a drinkable suspension prepared from crushed film-coated tablets was administered orally to patients with swallowing dysfunction Arm C - a suspension from a dispersible tablet administered via G-tube, in patients with swallowing dysfunction. Arm C was used to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), compared to Arm A (film coated tablet), and safety of the dispersible tablet of the dispersible tablet formulation of BYL719.~The Phase II investigated the clinical efficacy of BYL719 and consisted of an open label, randomized Phase II part investigating BYL719 in combination with cetuximab compared to cetuximab alone in patients resistant or intolerant to platinum and naïve to cetuximab (Scheme 1: Arm 1 and Arm 2), and a non-randomized Phase II part Scheme 2: Arm 3. In addition, patients who experienced disease progression in Arm 2 (cetuximab) were allowed to switch to the combination regimen (cross-over, Arm 2B). The safety of the BYL719 in combination with cetuximab was also further characterized in Arms 1, 2B and 3.~Patients were treated until progression of disease), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurred first (except for phase II Arm 2 had the opportunity to crossover to the combination treatment (Arm 2B).

"NCT00826202 D-Serine vs Placebo for the Schizophrenia Prodrome The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of D-serine as an early intervention treatment for the schizophrenia prodrome condition. This study is a placebo-controlled trial of D-serine in the symptomatic treatment of patients with the schizophrenia prodrome. Seventy two subjects meeting criteria for the schizophrenia prodrome will be included in this study, 24 at each site (Yale, Nathan Kline Institute and Zucker Hillside Hospital). The primary outcome measures will include symptom and neuropsychological measures. The duration of this study is two and a half years.~This research with D-serine holds out the prospect of direct benefit for the patient's current symptoms. Subjects may also benefit from the close monitoring of their symptoms, so that, if schizophrenic psychosis does occur, the psychosis will be recognized and treatment may begin with minimal delay. This study also could be of benefit by suggesting a promising lead in early intervention in the schizophrenic prodrome.~Overall Design Summary. We propose for prodromal patients to be randomized to D-serine vs placebo for 16 weeks. To insure that all subjects have the opportunity to receive D-serine, there will be an optional 16 week cross-over trial on the alternate study medication. No subject will be on D-serine for longer than 16 weeks. Admission criteria, Assessment Procedures, and Study Design will be the same across all sites. The procedures and timeline are shown in Table 1. The procedures and timeline are the same for the initial randomized 16 week trial and the optional cross-over trial on the alternate study medication. If patient's opt for the 16 week treatment on the alternate medication, we will use their assessments from end of initial treatment as baseline for 16 week treatment on alternate medication. Subjects will be seen for two preliminary visits, then once in treatment, subjects will be seen weekly for the first 5 visits then biweekly thereafter. A safety blood and urine collection will be done on day 3 (3 days after the start of study medication). Vital signs and weight, blood draw and urine collection for safety measures, urine pregnancy test and urine for toxicology will be repeated throughout treatment. Adverse effects ratings and symptom assessments will be repeated at each visit. Neuropsychological assessment and optional Biomarker study visual, auditory and ERPs tasks will be administered during one of the two preliminary visits then again at study endpoint. Any patients who convert to frank psychosis will be referred/offered immediate treatment. All 13 Years 35 Years Inclusion criteria:~treatment seeking subjects ages 13-35 who meet criteria for the schizophrenia prodrome (see criteria below) and who are able to give written informed assent or consent.~Subjects must score at least 20 on the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS) total score at visit -1.~Patients may be receiving ongoing treatment with antipsychotic, antidepressant or anti-anxiety medications as prescribed by their treating physician, or may be medication free.~Patients may enroll in the treatment phase only if they have been on fixed medication dosage for at least 4 weeks. If possible, medication will be held constant during course of study. Subjects will not be excluded or dropped from the study if they have a psychiatric diagnosis or must start a new medication unless the diagnosis is psychosis. Medication changes and increases or decreases in medication will be permitted at the discretion of the treating physician, and, if they occur, will be treated as secondary outcome measures.~Exclusion criteria:~inability to give informed assent or consent,~history of psychosis (e.g. frank delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder),~psychotropic medication begun or dose adjusted within 4 weeks of visit 0,~contraindication to study medication,~inclusion symptoms better accounted for by comorbid diagnosis,~treatment need for comorbid diagnosis outweighs that for prodromal symptoms,~unstable medical illness,~females who are of childbearing potential but are not taking adequate contraceptive precautions or who are pregnant or breast feeding,~alcohol or drug abuse or dependence in the past three months,~either of the following: Subjects with significant renal disease or estimated GFR below 60 (MDRD, http://www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator.cfm) will be excluded (see below for details).

This is a prospective, randomized, double blind study of 75 patients (n=25 for each group) in which epinephrine (100mcg or 200mcg) or normal saline vehicle is added to intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine (0.75% bupivacaine hydrochloride in 8.25% dextrose), fentanyl, and morphine to prolong the duration of the spinal anesthetic in scheduled cesarean deliveries. The primary outcome of duration will be the time to T10 level sensory regression as well as motor level regression that will be graded via the modified Bromage scale.~Repeat cesarean sections, in particular, are associated with increased operative time and thus often performed with a spinal-epidural (CSE) technique. The epidural component is, however, untested and may not provide adequate anesthesia, thus the higher risk of conversion to a general anesthesia. Epinephrine is routinely used to prolong spinal anesthesia. If effective for the duration of a repeat cesarean section it would obviate the additional time and risks of performing the epidural and still avoid sufficient duration to avoid conversion to a general anesthetic.

"NCT00160485 Glyburide Compared to Insulin in the Management of White's Classification A2 Gestational Diabetes The purpose of this study is to determine whether the oral administration of glyburide is as effective as insulin in the treatment of gestational diabetes.~SYNOPSIS: Infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes(GDM) are at risk for a variety of adverse perinatal outcomes including macrosomia with subsequent birth trauma and cesarean delivery, neonatal hypoglycemia, polycythemia, jaundice, hypocalcemia, respiratory depression and newborn intensive care unit admission. These adverse outcomes are thought to be related to the degree of maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy. Women with GDM are typically treated with insulin to lower blood glucose levels to as near-normal as possible. A single randomized trial has suggested that the oral sulfonylurea, glyburide is a clinically effective and safe alternative to insulin therapy.~Many obstetric care providers have adopted the use of glyburide in the routine management of gestational diabetes. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Diabetic Association both state that further studies are needed in a larger patient population before the use of newer oral hypoglycemic agents can be supported for use in pregnancy.~STATUS: Previous studies have demonstrated that there is no maternal-fetal transfer of glyburide and when compared to insulin is an effective alternative to insulin. Additionally, a published cost analysis concluded that glyburide is significantly less costly than insulin for the treatment of GDM. The benefits of an oral agent for the management of gestational diabetes include less discomfort for the patient in drug administration, lower requirement for patient education in the administration of injectable medications and less chance of error in dosing. Our study population is more ethnically diverse and our incidence of large for gestational age infants is lower than in the largely Hispanic population studied by Langer et al. Many obstetricians, including ourselves, apply different criteria than Langer for diagnosing gestational diabetes , and for deciding when to institute insulin therapy. It is our goal to confirm the prior single study concerning the safety and efficacy of glyburide in reducing the complications of GDM utilizing a more ethnically diverse population with more realistic goals in glycemic control. To this end we will add to the medical literature supporting this alternative therapy to insulin.

"NCT04542148 Glycemic Control After Antenatal Corticosteroids in Women With Pregestational and Gestational Diabetes (Close the GAP) There is a fundamental gap in understanding the maternal and neonatal effects of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration in women with threatened preterm birth (PTB) who have diabetes. Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM, and there is limited data among women with gestational diabetes. While ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS in women with diabetes. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with diabetes as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims will determine the optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform a larger, multicenter trial to improve neonatal outcomes among women with diabetes and threatened PTB. All N/A 50 Years Inclusion Criteria:~Gestational or pregestational type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with daily insulin injection(s) or oral hypoglycemic agents such as metformin~Hospitalized for antenatal corticosteroid administration in anticipation of preterm birth~Gestational age 23 0/7 weeks - 36 5/7 weeks~Maternal age 18-50~Exclusion Criteria:~Planned delivery < 72 hours after 1st dose of antenatal corticosteroids~More than 16 hours after 1st dose of antenatal corticosteroids~Major fetal anomaly~Triplet or higher order multiple gestation diabetes mellitus, type 2~preterm birth~pregnancy, high risk~diabetes, gestational"
"NCT06032546 A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Budigalimab and/or ABBV-382 in People Living With HIV on Stable Antiretroviral Therapy Undergoing Analytical Treatment Interruption Human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV disease is considered to be a chronic disease requiring lifelong therapy. The purpose of this study is to assess change in disease activity, adverse events, tolerability, and how the drug moves through the body.~Budigalimab and ABBV-382 are investigational drugs being developed for the treatment of HIV disease. Participants are placed in 1 of 5 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. There is a 1 in 7 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo (A placebo is not a drug and it is not expected to have any chemical effects on your body and it is not designed to treat any disease or illness). Approximately 140 adult participants living with HIV disease on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) willing to undergo Analytical Treatment Interruption (ATI) will be enrolled at approximately 90 sites worldwide.~Participants will receive 4 doses of IV budigalimab or placebo combined with 3 doses of IV ABBV-382 or placebo for an 8 week dosing period. Participants need to be stable on antiretroviral therapy to participate in the study. If participant qualifies to the study, on the day they receive the first injection, participants will be asked to stop antiretroviral medications (also referred to as analytical treatment interruption or ATI) for 52 weeks or until meeting specific criteria to restart antiretroviral medications. Participants will undergo a closely monitored ART interruption. Protocol-defined ART restart criteria includes participant's request. Participants will be followed for up to approximately 52 weeks.~There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. There will be an option for virtual or home health visits for some of the follow-up visits. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.

"NCT02662023 Continuous Transversus Abdominis Plane Nerve Blocks: Relative Effects of a Basal Infusion vs. Repeated Bolus Doses (A Randomized, Double-Masked, Active-Control, Split-Body, Crossover Study) Single-injection transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks have been used to treat postoperative pain, and are become very popular within the United States because of their high analgesic potency and relative ease of placement. Unfortunately, the longest local anesthetic available lasts only 8-12 hours. Continuous TAP blocks-also termed perineural infusion-involve bathing the multiple nerves of the abdominal wall in local anesthetic using a percutaneously-inserted perineural catheter inserted just anterior (ventral) and cephalad to the anterior superior iliac spine. For most catheter locations, an infusion is preferred to a single-injection nerve block because the duration of analgesia may be extended to better match the duration of surgical pain. But, unlike brachial plexus, femoral, and sciatic nerve perineural infusion, a continuous basal infusion of local anesthetic does not provide adequate analgesia for TAP catheters. This may be due to the fact that the TAP is a relatively tight space, so it might require a bolus of fluid to adequately spread the perineural local anesthetic to the multiple required nerves (as evidence of this, single-injection TAP blocks are very effective, although with a limited duration). The result is that while single-injection TAP blocks are widely used, TAP catheters have not been adopted. This scenario leaves surgical pain untreated following the resolution of the single-injection TAP block. The recent development of an infusion pump that can automatically deliver repeated bolus doses may allow the spread of local anesthetic to the multiple sensory nerves necessary to provide adequate analgesia, with a duration that better matches postoperative requirements. The investigators therefore propose a randomized, double-masked, controlled trial to determine if delivering local anesthetic as a repeated bolus dose results in improved local anesthetic spread/effects compared with a continuous basal infusion for TAP catheters.

"NCT04333537 Randomized Phase II/III Trial of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Versus Elective Neck Dissection for Early-Stage Oral Cavity Cancer This phase II/III trial studies how well sentinel lymph node biopsy works and compares sentinel lymph node biopsy surgery to standard neck dissection as part of the treatment for early-stage oral cavity cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy surgery is a procedure that removes a smaller number of lymph nodes from your neck because it uses an imaging agent to see which lymph nodes are most likely to have cancer. Standard neck dissection, such as elective neck dissection, removes many of the lymph nodes in your neck. Using sentinel lymph node biopsy surgery may work better in treating patients with early-stage oral cavity cancer compared to standard elective neck dissection.

"NCT01593722 Comparison Between the Post-Treatment Reactions After Single-dose Ivermectin or DEC in Subjects With Loa Loa Infection Background:~Loa loa is a small worm that infects people in West and Central Africa. It is spread by the bite of a fly. Adult worms live under the skin and can cause swelling in the arms, legs, and face. Some people have more serious infections in the heart, kidneys, or brain. Most people with Loa loa infection have no symptoms at all. The standard treatment for Loa loa infection is a medicine called diethylcarbamazine (DEC). Some people have bad reactions to DEC, including itching, muscle pains, and in severe cases coma and death.~Another drug, ivermectin, is used in mass drug treatment programs to prevent the spread of worm infections that cause blindness and massive swelling (elephantiasis). However, people who also have Loa loa have had serious bad reactions to ivermectin. Researchers want to study both DEC and ivermectin to find out why these reactions occur. If they can be prevented, mass drug treatment programs will be able to be used in areas in Africa where Loa loa exists.~Objectives:~- To study the side effects of DEC and ivermectin treatment for Loa loa infection.~Eligibility:~- Individuals who live in 4 villages in Cameroon where Loa loa infection is known to exist, who are between 20 and 60 years of age, not pregnant or breastfeeding and have a low level of Loa loa parasites in the blood, but are otherwise healthy.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples will be collected to check for Loa loa infection. Participants will also have an eye exam and provide skin samples to check for other worm infections that may interfere with the study treatment.~Participants will be admitted to the hospital for 4 days (during and after the treatment). They will receive a single dose of either DEC or ivermectin.~After treatment, regular blood samples will be collected. Participants will be asked questions about how they feel after treatment. Physical exams will be performed. If side effects develop, participants will be treated at the hospital.~After leaving the hospital, participants will have followup visits. These visits will happen on days 5, 7, 9, and 14 after receiving the study medicine. They will involve a short physical exam and collection of blood samples.~At the end of the study, participants will be offered a full 21-day DEC treatment to cure the Loa loa infection.

"NCT00710086 Remifentanil Intravenous Patient-controlled Labor Analgesia for Nulliparous Women Labor analgesia is an essential health caring procedure for women. However, epidural analgesia cannot be performed on all subjects for different contraindications, such as lower platelet counter, back infection at the puncture site, and fear of epidural injection etc. Therefore, intravenous analgesia is an alternative for such conditions. Given the influence of intravenous administration of drugs on fetus, the drug selection is very important. Remifentanil, a super-short efficacious opioid, can last for 3-4 minutes after injection, which is similar in both maternal and fetal environment. Thus the fetus-associated side effects would be less than other drugs. The investigators hypothesized that remifentanil would be a superior intravenous drug used with patient-controlled technique for labor analgesia.

"NCT02278562 Nutrition, Inflammation and Insulin Resistance in End-Stage Renal Disease By 2030 an estimated 2 million people in the US will need dialysis or transplantation for advanced kidney failure. An even more disturbing statistic is that mortality in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is six times higher than in the general Medicare population with adjustment for age, gender and ethnicity. Protein energy wasting is highly prevalent in these patients and is one of the most important determinants of their poor clinical outcome.~Despite its well-recognized occurrence, the etiology and the mechanisms leading to protein energy wasting observed in chronic hemodialysis patients cannot be attributed to any single factor. However, irrespective of the specific etiologic mechanisms, it appears that the common pathway for all the metabolic derangements is related to exaggerated protein degradation relative to protein synthesis (47).~Two well-recognized and presumably interrelated metabolic abnormalities, insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, may be the major determinants of protein catabolism in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. There are no studies examining the effects of anti-inflammatory interventions and/or insulin sensitizers on protein homeostasis in CHD. Due to their established anti-inflammatory and other pleiotropic effects, Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra and insulin sensitizer peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) agonist Actos represent two such promising interventions. By modulating inflammatory response and insulin signaling through two pharmacological interventions, the investigators will have the unique opportunity to clarify mechanisms contributing of these two particular metabolic derangements in the development of protein energy wasting observed in chronic hemodialysis patients.~The overall goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic inflammation and insulin resistance influence the development of protein energy wasting in hemodialysis patients.~Specific Aim: To test the hypothesis that inhibiting inflammatory response by administration of an Interleukin1receptor antagonist (Anakinra) or increasing insulin sensitivity by administration of a PPAR agonist (Actos) will improve net protein metabolism.~Hypothesis: The chronic inflammatory component of protein energy wasting (PEW) observed in hemodialysis patients is, at least in part, mediated by insulin resistance.~Interim analysis may be performed (no specific plan at this time).

"NCT00356187 Beta-blockade Reduces Catabolism in Severely Injured Trauma Patients Critically injured patients endure a period of hypermetabolism/catabolism after being resuscitated. The metabolic cost of this may be measured in loss of lean body mass, poor wound healing, susceptibility to infection and long hospital stays. While there have been some data to suggest that hypermetabolism can be ameliorated in burn patients by beta blockade, to our knowledge, a prospective trial in trauma patients has not yet been done. Our hypothesis is that nonselective beta blockade will reduce catabolism, improve glucose control, blunt loss of lean body mass, decrease infections and improve outcome in a cohort of critically injured patients.

"NCT03195413 Early Ultrasound-guided Nerve Block for Painful Hand Injuries in the Emergency Department This study aims to determine whether early initiation of temporary nerve block therapy improves patient satisfaction, decreases patient pain and discomfort, decreases the use of dangerous medications such as narcotics, and frees hospital resources. Hand injuries, such as blast injuries from fireworks, can be very painful. In the emergency department, providers generally use narcotic pain medications to control pain, but these have significant side effects. It is possible that temporary nerve blocks, guided by ultrasound, can be safe and useful in the emergency department. They have been shown to be effective in several studies around the country. The goal of this study is to build on the experience of others to increase the use of US-guided regional nerve blocks as a form of pain management in hand and distal forearm injuries in the Harborview Medical Center (HMC) emergency department. By working with a multidisciplinary team, the study investigators hope to use this technique to decrease narcotic use and improve pain control, and to provide important data for Emergency Medicine physicians elsewhere who are considering incorporating this nerve block technique into their practice.

"NCT02393573 Attenuating The Post-Operative Insulin Resistance And Promoting Protein Anabolism In Patients Undergoing Major Lung or Abdominal Surgery Major surgery results in a stress- induced catabolic response, marked by post-operative insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and loss of body protein, which is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and adverse outcomes. There has been a great deal of research on different approaches to optimize post-operative insulin sensitivity including hormonal and nutritional interventions, minimally invasive surgical techniques and epidural anesthesia. However, the correlation between insulin resistance and body protein loss is not well understood. Metformin is the most widely used insulin sensitizing and blood glucose-lowering drug in treatment of type 2 diabetic patients. This study will: 1) estimate the correlation between insulin resistance and body protein loss in pre-diabetic lung/colorectal resection patients; 2) investigate whether the post-operative metabolic state can be improved by the pre-operative administration of metformin; and assess the impact of metformin on surgical complications and hospital length of stay. The results of this study will provide insight into the relationship between insulin resistance and post-operative adverse events and potentially suggest a novel approach to improve outcomes using Metformin, a drug already in wide clinical use.

"NCT00374309 A Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Recombinant Ebola Adenoviral Vector Vaccine, VRC-EBOADV018-00-VP, in Healthy Adults This study will determine if an experimental vaccine to prevent Ebola virus infection is safe and what side effects, if any, it causes. Ebola virus infection may range from mild to severe, and may cause breathing problems, severe bleeding, kidney problems and shock that can lead to death. The vaccine used in this study contains man-made genetic material similar to one part of the Ebola virus, which is designed to stimulate an immune response to the virus. The vaccine itself cannot cause Ebola virus infection because it does not contain any Ebola virus.~Participants are assigned to one of three groups as they enter into the study. Of the first 16 people in the study, 12 receive the lowest study dose of vaccine and 4 receive placebo (an inactive substance). If this dose is safe, then of the next 16 people who enter the study, 12 receive a higher dose of the vaccine, and the remaining 4 receive placebo. If this dose is safe, the final 12 people in the last group of 16 receive the highest study dose, and 4 receive placebo. The vaccine is given as a single injection in the arm on the day of enrollment.~Participants keep a diary for 5 days, recording their temperature, symptoms and any reaction at the injection site. They call a study nurse the day after vaccination to report how they feel, and they return to the clinic approximately six times for follow-up evaluations.

"NCT02026297 The Influence of Prophylactic Tranexamic Acid on Thromboelastography During Cesarean Delivery: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial The aim of this study is to characterize the coagulation changes, using thromboelastography (TEG), after prophylactic tranexamic administration during cesarean delivery. Specifically, TEG values will be compared in patients who receive prophylactic tranexamic acid or placebo before surgery, during elective cesarean delivery, and 2 hours postpartum.~Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is increasing in incidence in the United States, renewing interest in multimodal approaches to blood conservation during cesarean delivery. Pharmacologic therapy with the antifibrinolytic agent, tranexamic acid (TA), has been shown to reduce estimated blood loss (EBL) during cesarean delivery, but its effect on global coagulation as assessed by TEG, and how this correlates with lowering blood loss, has not been elucidated.~This study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with two study arms: control (60 patients); and treatment (60 patients).~Subjects will be pre-medicated with routine pre-cesarean delivery medications including oral sodium citrate 30 mL and intravenous (IV) metoclopramide 10 mg. A peripheral IV and noninvasive hemoglobin monitor will be placed, and baseline labs sent: type and screen, serum hemoglobin, platelet count, fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and baseline TEG values (r time, k time, alpha angle, and maximum amplitude). Patients will have blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry measured throughout surgery as per standard of care. Patients will all receive IV lactated Ringers' (LR) solution prior to surgery and throughout surgery, with volume recorded and a goal of less than 2 L unless more IV fluid is clinically indicated.

"NCT02062801 Prophylactic Ephedrine to Reduce Fetal Bradycardia After Combined Spinal Epidural Labor Analgesia: a Randomized Double Blind Placebo-controlled Study The combined spinal epidural (CSE) technique has become increasingly popular for labor pain because of its rapid onset and superior first stage analgesia. However, increased risk for early profound fetal bradycardia (EPFB) following CSE continues to be a concern. Various factors are implicated in the etiology of EPFB but the cause is unknown. Ephedrine administration prior to CSE analgesia may help reduce the risk of EPFB, but to date, nobody has studied the impact of a single dose of intravenous (IV) ephedrine given at the time of CSE administration during labor. The purpose of this study is to measure the incidence of EPFB after combined spinal epidural analgesia using standard definitions. The incidence of EPFB will be compared between patients who receive prophylactic ephedrine or placebo at the time of CSE placement.

"NCT03824119 Effect of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Use on Blood Pressure in Women With Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy: A Randomized Open Label Trial Previous studies have suggested that NSAID use causes an increase in blood pressure. Further, blood pressure elevation has been noted in women with pregnancy related hypertensive disease during the postpartum period. NSAIDs remain part of standard postpartum care in women with hypertensive disease. The objective of this study is to determine whether postpartum standard care withholding NSAID use is associated with a clinically significant reduction in postpartum hypertension in women with pregnancy induced hypertension. The investigators hypothesize that women with pregnancy induced hypertensive disease will be half as likely to have blood pressure elevation of 150/100 mmHg in the first 24 hours postpartum.~This study is an open label randomized trial of women with antepartum hypertension.

"NCT02528981 Effect of Probiotics on GBS Colonization Status During Pregnancy: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in Canada. It may be passed from a study participant colonized in the genital tract by GBS to their baby during vaginal birth. While approximately 10 to 30% of pregnant people harbour GBS in the vagina or rectum, the incidence of neonatal GBS disease is 1 to 2 infants per 1000 births. The use of intrapartum antibiotics to treat colonized individuals with or without risk factors has led to a 70% decline in the incidence of early-onset GBS sepsis in the past decade. Despite this impressive decline, antibiotic resistance has become a major public health concern. Association between intrapartum antibiotic use and ampicillin resistance in E. coli isolated from neonates has previously been documented. Furthermore, while GBS has remained sensitive to penicillin, 20% are resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, which are alternate drugs for patients allergic to penicillin. Alternative approaches are therefore needed to reduce the risk of GBS infection.~We therefore propose to study the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 (Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14) in the colonization status of GBS in pregnant people. Lactobacilli are part of normal gut and vaginal flora and have been widely used as probiotics to treat various conditions. In particular, these two strains have shown to be beneficial in the treatment of urinary tract infections and bacterial vaginosis. Our study design involves recruiting two hundred pregnant people (one hundred in each arm) through various midwifery practices in the GTA at the end of their first trimester of pregnancy. These individuals will be randomized to receive probiotics or placebo for twelve weeks of their pregnancies and will be cultured before delivery to determine their colonization status. The capsules with probiotics and placebo will be provided free of charge. The study design was chosen to minimize the cost and clients' visits to the clinic as vaginal/rectal swabs are routinely offered at 35-37 weeks of gestation.

"NCT00458003 Phenylephrine Versus Ephedrine to Treat Spinal Anesthesia-Induced Hypotension in Preeclamptic Patients During Cesarean Delivery Hypotension remains a common clinical problem after induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Maternal hypotension has been associated with considerable morbidity (maternal nausea and vomiting and fetal/neonatal acidemia). Traditionally, ephedrine has been the vasopressor of choice because of concerns about phenylephrine's potential adverse effect on uterine blood flow. This practice was based on animal studies which showed that ephedrine maintained cardiac output and uterine blood flow, while direct acting vasoconstrictors, e.g., phenylephrine, decreased uteroplacental perfusion. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that phenylephrine has similar efficacy to ephedrine for preventing and treating hypotension and may be associated with a lower incidence of fetal acidosis. All of these studies have been performed in healthy patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery.~Preeclampsia complicates 5-6% of all pregnancies and is a significant contributor to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Many preeclamptic patients require cesarean delivery of the infant. These patients often have uteroplacental insufficiency. Given the potential for significant hypotension after spinal anesthesia and its effect on an already compromised fetus, prevention of (relative) hypotension in preeclamptic patients is important. Spinal anesthesia in preeclamptic patients has been shown to have no adverse neonatal outcomes as compared to epidural anesthesia when hypotension is treated adequately. Due to problems related to management of the difficult airway and coagulopathy, both of which are more common in preeclamptic women, spinal anesthesia may be the preferred regional anesthesia technique. Recent studies have demonstrated that preeclamptic patients may experience less hypotension after spinal anesthesia than their healthy counterparts. To our knowledge, phenylephrine for the treatment of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension has not been studied in women with preeclampsia. The aim of our study is to compare intravenous infusion regimens of phenylephrine versus ephedrine for the treatment of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension in preeclamptic patients undergoing cesarean delivery. The primary outcome variable is umbilical artery pH.

"NCT04344860 Prospective, Randomized Trial Comparing Recombinant Von Willebrand Factor (rVWF) Plus Tranexamic Acid vs. rVWF Alone to Reduce Postpartum Hemorrhage in Women With Von Willebrand Disease: The VWD-WOMAN Trial This is a single-center randomized phase III clinical trial, the VWD-Woman Trial, in which 20 pregnant subjects with von Willebrand disease (VWD), defined as VWF ristocetin co-factor activity (VWF:RCo) <0.50 IU/ml (historic) and previous history of bleeding are enrolled. Subjects will include women with VWD age 18 years and older, excluding those who have a bleeding disorder other than VWD. Once enrolled, subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to recombinant Von Willebrand factor (rVWF, Vonvendi ®) with Tranexamic Acid (TA, Cyclokapron®); or recombinant Von Willebrand factor (rVWF, Vonvendi®) alone to prevent postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal or caesarean delivery. The primary endpoint is quantitative blood loss (QBL) by a labor suite nurse at delivery. Secondary endpoints include safety assessment for postpartum lochial blood loss by Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC), transfusion, blood products, thromboembolic events, and hysterectomy within 21 days; and mechanism of PPH reduction by VWF assays (VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, VIII:C), fibrinogen, and d-dimer. Blood draws are at 5 time points, including at 36 weeks' gestation (screening), on admission for childbirth, and at 1 day, 2 days, and 21 days after delivery. The VWD-Woman Trial is considered greater than minimal risk as study drugs are given at delivery and special coagulation studies are obtained.

"NCT03427463 Comparison of 0.1 and 0.05mg Intrathecal Morphine When Administered With a Multimodal Pain Regimen for Post-cesarean Analgesia The purpose of this study is to determine the ideal dose of spinal morphine for use in Cesarean section. Spinal anesthesia (single injection in the lower back to numb patients from the waist down) is commonly used in Cesarean section to provide numbness and pain relief during the surgery, and adding morphine to the spinal anesthetic provides long lasting pain relief for up to 24 hours after surgery. The ideal dose of spinal morphine, when given with other types of pain medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and acetaminophen, has not been determined. In addition, spinal morphine can have side effects such as nausea and itching, so using a lower dose of morphine may decrease these side effects while providing the same amount of postoperative pain relief. Study participants will be divided into two groups. Group 1 will receive the standard dose of spinal morphine (0.1mg) while Group 2 will receive a lower dose of spinal morphine (0.05mg). Both groups will receive the standard dose of spinal bupivacaine (numbing medication) and spinal fentanyl (short acting pain medication). The additional pain medications (IV Toradol and oral acetaminophen) will be given to both groups after surgery. Pain control and morphine side effects will be compared between the two groups in order to determine the best dose of spinal morphine for cesarean section. Female 18 Years N/A Inclusion Criteria:~any parturient 18 years of age or older~undergoing elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia~able to consent to the study and participate in the follow-up.~Exclusion Criteria:~any known allergy to morphine~general anesthesia~urgent or emergent cases~any bleeding diathesis or other coagulopathy~known G6PD deficiency~any known liver disease~known alcohol abuse or dependence~HELLP syndrome~thrombocytopenia or known platelet dysfunction~history or active gastrointestinal bleeding~acute kidney injury or chronic renal insufficiency~contraindication/refusal to spinal anesthestic~chronic pain~chronic narcotic use~illicit drug use~allergy to any study related medications cesarean section"

"NCT00790478 Melatonin and Ulcerative Colitis: A Pilot Clinical Trial Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease that afflicts up to one million people in the U.S. Symptoms include rectal urgency, bloody diarrhea, moderate to severe abdominal pain, fever, and fatigue. Melatonin is a hormone that is associated with sleep and other body functions that may be related to health. Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland and, in fact, it is produced in even greater amounts in the gut. Melatonin appears to be important in gastrointestinal tract physiology and health, and data from cell and animal experiments, and some studies in humans, suggest that supplemental melatonin may help ameliorate colitis. Given that current treatments for ulcerative colitis are not always effective, and often have serious side effects, there is considerable interest in finding alternative treatments for this disease. However, experimental data on the ability of melatonin to improve ulcerative colitis in humans are lacking. To address this, we plan to conduct a pilot clinical trial (60 adult male and female participants) that will obtain preliminary data about the effectiveness of melatonin supplementation as a treatment for ulcerative colitis in adult men and women with the disease.~The Melatonin and Ulcerative Colitis study funded by a grant from the Broad Foundation's Broad Medical Research Program (http://www.broadmedical.org).

"NCT04393207 Transverse Abdominis Plane Block Using Liposomal Bupivacaine for Post-operative Cesarean Delivery Analgesia- Walking Towards Recovery The TAP block offers analgesia by blocking the sensory nerves of the anterior abdominal wall. The procedure is performed under ultrasound guidance, after identification of the external oblique, internal oblique and transverse abdominis muscle. Medication is injected in the neurofascial plane between the internal oblique and the tranversus abdominis muscle.~Previous studies have demonstrated limited (<24 hour) effect of the block when compared to the use of intrathecal morphine (considered to be the gold standard for postoperative analgesia). In a study by McMarrow et al., post-caesarian pain control combinations including TAP blocks with local anesthetic (Bupivacaine) or saline after a spinal anesthetic with or without intrathecal morphine were compared.~At 6 hours the Morphine consumption was slightly reduced in the patients that received both intrathecal morphine and TAP blocks with LA when compared to patients that received spinal saline and TAP with saline. At 24 hours the TAP block conferred no benefit in terms of opioid consumption. Similarly, the study by Lee et al. demonstrated better pain scores for the first 2 hours in patients receiving both intrathecal morphine and a TAP block with ropivacaine. At 24 hours there was no difference in the pain scores for patients that received both intrathecal morphine and TAP blocks.~On the contrary, a more recent study utilizing liposomal bupivacaine has been utilized for TAP blocks for post cesarean delivery analgesia, demonstrating opioid reductions for up to 72 hours. Liposomal bupivacaine is a novel, multivesicular formulation designed for rapid absorption, prolonged release of bupivacaine, and analgesia following a single intra-operative administration into the surgical wound or for TAP blocks.~Current anesthesia practices encourage the use of multimodal analgesia that aim at enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). The ERAS model aims to decrease immobility, pain and post-operative ileus. Pain and immobility may be closely related, and the latter has rarely been monitored in the post-operative setting. It is planned to use a research validated fit-bit like device (Actigraph GT3-X) to monitor patient steps (mobility).

"NCT00817713 Can Anthelminthic Treatment Delay the Progression of HIV? Randomised Open-label Trial Testing Presumptive Anthelminthic Treatment on Progression of HIV in ART-naïve HIV-positive Patients in a Rural African Setting With Presumed High Prevalence of Helminth Infections. This study focuses on one of the major health issues of Sub-Saharan Africa: multi-parasitism and co-infections. In particular this study aims to elucidate the interaction of helminths with HIV.~There is good reason to suspect a detrimental effect of helminth infection on the course of HIV infection. We hypothesize, that treatment of helminths in HIV- and helminth co-infected individuals leads to a reduction of HIV viral load. With a lower HIV RNA level one would expect a slower decline of CD4 cells and hence also a slower progression of the disease. Ideally this would lead to a prolongation of the chronic phase of HIV infection and to a delay in the time when anti-retroviral treatment needs to be started.

"NCT04741698 Propranolol for Prolonged Labor: A Randomized Controlled Trial (PRO-Labor Trial) Induction of labor is one of the most common procedures performed on labor and delivery. In the United States, more than 20 percent of pregnant women undergo an induction of labor [1].~There is data from small, randomized studies that demonstrates the effectiveness of propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, for labor augmentation. This literature suggests a decrease in the amount of time to delivery and a possible reduction in cesarean section rates when propranolol is used in conjunction with oxytocin for induction of labor compared to oxytocin alone [2-8].~Alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors have been identified in the human myometrium. Propranolol has been shown in studies to enhance uterine contractions and may be a useful tool in this population of women. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess whether the administration of propranolol at time of labor dystocia reduces time to delivery.

At the start of the trial (stage 1), participants will be randomized with a ratio 2:2:1 to one of three treatment arms: Arm A: trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) per intravenous injection (IV) every 3 weeks; Arm B: trastuzumab emtansine 2.4 mg/kg IV every week; Arm C: standard taxane therapy (docetaxel 75 milligram per meter square [mg/m^2] IV every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 kg IV every week per investigator choice). At the end of the first stage of the study, the dose and schedule of trastuzumab emtansine that will be used in the second stage of the study will be selected by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The regimen selection analysis will be made after approximately 100 participants across all three study arms have been treated for at least 12 weeks.~Once a trastuzumab emtansine regimen has been selected, Stage I participants who were assigned to the treatment arm which was selected for Stage II of the study and participants who were in the standard taxane group will continue to receive their assigned treatment regimen. Stage I participants who were assigned to the regimen that was not selected for further evaluation will continue to receive their assigned regimen and will continue to be followed for efficacy and safety. In Stage II of the study, additional participants will be recruited and randomized with a ratio 2:1 to either the selected regimen of trastuzumab emtansine or to the standard taxane therapy.

"NCT02163447 Reducing the Burden of Malaria in HIV-uninfected Pregnant Women and Infants (PROMOTE Birth Cohort 1) This will be a double-blinded randomized controlled phase III trial of 300 HIV uninfected pregnant women and the children born to them. The study interventions will be divided into two phases. In the first phase, HIV uninfected women at 12-20 weeks gestation will be randomized in equal proportions to one of three intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy (IPTp) treatment arms: 1) 3 doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), 2) 3 doses of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), or 3) monthly DP. All three interventions arms will have either SP or DP placebo to ensure adequate blinding is achieved. Follow-up for the pregnant women will end approximately 6 weeks after giving birth. In the second phase of the study, all children born to mothers enrolled in the study will be followed from birth until they reach 36 months of age. Children born to mothers randomized to receive 3 doses of SP during pregnancy will receive DP every 3 months between 2-24 months of age. Children born to mothers randomized to receive 3 doses of DP or monthly DP during pregnancy will receive either DP every 3 months or monthly DP between 2-24 months of age. To ensure adequate blinding, children who will receive DP every 3 months will be given DP placebo during the months they will not be taking DP. Children will then be followed an additional year between 24-36 months of age following the interventions. We will test the hypothesis that IPT with DP will significantly reduce the burden of malaria in pregnancy and infancy and improve the development of naturally acquired antimalarial immunity.

"NCT02519231 A Multi-Center, Double-Blinded, Randomized, Phase IV 6-Month Pilot Study to Compare Bleeding Patterns, Satisfaction and Quality of Life Among New Copper 380A IUD Users Treated With Naproxen Sodium (440mg Twice Daily) Versus Placebo Studies indicate that bleeding irregularities and dysmenorrhea are common reasons for copper IUD method discontinuation. Some evidence suggests that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) can help improve bleeding during Cu-IUD use. However, these studies did not examine NSAID use with the TCu380A specifically, nor did they evaluate readily available NSAIDs such as over-the-counter naproxen. For this reason, the investigators propose a pilot trial in which new TCu380A users complaining of heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding or spotting after 1 month of use are randomized to naproxen or placebo to be taken the first 7 days of menstruation for three consecutive cycles, and then observed for one cycle without treatment. Female 18 Years 49 Years Inclusion Criteria:~• Age ≥ 18 and < 49 years. We are including a wide range of ages because women of all ages request TCu380A. While we recognize that some women approaching menopause (median age = 51.4 years) may have changes in their baseline menstruation, we trust that clinicians enrolling the patients into the study will ensure that these women meet all inclusion (i.e., regular cycles) and exclusion criteria (i.e., do not have diagnosis of menorrhagia).~Requesting to have TCu380A IUD inserted as contraceptive method.~English-speaking.~Regular menstrual cycles ranging 21-35 days apart.~Generally healthy.~Willing to attend a 4- to 6-week follow-up visit and complete surveys.~Exclusion Criteria:~Known or suspected pregnancy.~Contraindications to NSAID use.

"NCT01840228 Vaginal Progesterone for the Prevention of Preterm Birth in Women With Arrested Preterm Labor Preterm birth, defined as birth before 37 weeks' gestation, is a leading cause of infant death and disease. Progesterone is the single most effective intervention in the prevention of preterm birth. However, current use of this therapy is limited to certain high-risk groups including women with a history of preterm birth and women with a short cervix. This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of this preventive therapy in another high-risk group: women with arrested preterm labor. The investigators hypothesize that administration of vaginal progesterone in women who present with preterm labor but remain undelivered 12 hours after cessation of short-term therapy to inhibit contractions will result in lower rates of preterm birth before 37 weeks' than will administration of placebo.

"NCT00084318 A Phase II Randomized Trial Of Surgery Followed By Chemoradiotherapy Plus Cetuximab For Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma Of The Head and Neck RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Cisplatin and docetaxel may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining a monoclonal antibody with chemoradiotherapy and giving them after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.~PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying adjuvant cetuximab given together with chemoradiotherapy using cisplatin to see how well it works compared to adjuvant cetuximab given together with chemoradiotherapy using docetaxel in treating patients with resected stage III or stage IV squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) or lymphoepithelioma of the head and neck.

"NCT03508440 Intratympanic Steroid Injection for Treatment of Idiopathic Facial Nerve Paralysis Facial nerve paralysis is due to inflammation around the facial nerve. Current treatment for facial nerve paralysis is a 10 day course of oral steroids (which will reduce the inflammation), with electrodiagnostic testing. There have been limited studies on the use of intratympanic steroid injection, in addition to oral steroid, in the recovery of facial nerve paralysis. There are indications that the use of intratympanic injections, in addition to the oral steroids, will speed up the recovery rate of the facial nerve paralysis, as well as improve the complete recovery of the facial nerve paralysis. This study will randomize patients with facial nerve paralysis into two groups: 1) oral steroid only and 2) oral steroid plus a 3 intratympanic steroid injections spaced out over three weeks. There are a subset of patients that are unable to take oral steroids for medical reasons (such as diabetes); these patients will be placed into a third group and only receive 3 intratympanic steroid injections space out over three weeks. Subjects that are to receive the intratympanic injection will receive pre- and post-hearing exams as part of their standard of care.

"NCT06179888 Randomized Phase 2 Study of Iberdomide Maintenance Therapy Following Idecaptagene Vicleucel CAR-T in Multiple Myeloma Patients This phase II trial compares iberdomide maintenance therapy to disease monitoring for improving survival in patients who have received idecabtagene vicleucel (a type of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell [CAR-T] therapy) for multiple myeloma. The usual approach after treatment with idecabtagene vicleucel is to monitor the multiple myeloma without giving myeloma medications. There is currently no medication approved specifically for use after idecabtagene vicleucel treatment. Upon administration, iberdomide modifies the immune system and activates immune cells called T-cells, which could enhance the effectiveness of idecabtagene vicleucel. Iberdomide may keep multiple myeloma under control for longer than the usual approach (disease monitoring) after idecabtagene vicleucel, and may help multiple myeloma patients live longer.

"NCT03106753 Success of External Cephalic Version With Immediate Spinal Anesthesia Versus Spinal Anesthesia When Attempt Without Anesthesia Has Failed: A Randomized Controlled Trial The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to optimize the success of external cephalic version (turning the baby from the outside). Attempting to turn babies in-utero is recommended because it may decrease the risk of needing a cesarean section for abnormal presentation. While the study team knows that this procedure can be effective, the study team still has some un-answered questions as to the best way to perform this procedure to increase the chance of success. Many prior studies have shown that using spinal anesthesia (a shot of medication placed in your back to numb and relax the abdomen) can increase the success rate of a version. This ultimately has led to the finding that using this anesthesia can decrease the rate of cesarean section. However, there have been only a small number of studies assessing the success rate if spinal anesthesia is used only in the event that without it fails. Therefore the study team is going to compare patients who receive spinal anesthesia with those who only receive spinal anesthesia if the procedure to turn the baby (ECV) fails without it. Female 18 Years 60 Years Inclusion Criteria:~Patients included are those with singleton pregnancies of at least 37 weeks gestation in nonvertex presentation with no contraindication for a vaginal delivery.~Membranes must be intact with a minimum of a 2x2 pocket and Category 1 non-stress test.~Exclusion Criteria:~All patients with a contraindication for a vaginal delivery will be excluded from the study.~Patients with gross fetal anomalies or uterine malformations.~Patients with contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia or allergies to any of the study medications will also be excluded. external cephalic version"
"NCT01465191 Effect of OPRM1 Genotype on the Dose Response to Spinal Morphine for Post-Cesarean Analgesia HYPOTHESIS: The response to a given dose of morphine given via a spinal anesthetic for cesarean section will be affected by the genetics of the woman's mu-opioid receptor~Most women undergoing elective cesarean section (CS) receive spinal anesthesia, and most receive a dose of preservative free morphine with the spinal anesthetic. Spinally-administered morphine provides 16-24 hours of high quality pain relief. The dose administered is usually 75-200 micrograms, but surprisingly few dose-response studies exist.~The mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1 gene)is the site of action of endogenous opioid peptides and opioid analgesic drugs like morphine. There is a common genetic variant of this receptor at the 40th amino acid of the protein, with asparagine and asparate being present in different people. The less common variant (aspartate), present in 25-30% of the overall American population (higher in Asian populations, lower in Blacks) at codon 40 that has been shown in many studies to affect opioid analgesia.~This will be a randomized, blinded study of 3 doses of spinal morphine (50, 100, 150 micrograms) given to women undergoing elective cesarean section at term pregnancy. 300 women will be studied (100 per dose). Blood will be obtained for genotyping of OPRM1 and other genes that may affect pain and analgesic responses. The primary outcome will be the amount of intravenous morphine patients self-administer in the 24 hours postsurgery.~The primary outcome (use of intravenous morphine) will be analyzed by dose, and within each dose group by genotype of OPRM1. Secondary outcomes will include pain scores every 6 hours, satisfaction with analgesia, side effects (itching, nausea/vomiting) by dose and genotype.~It is anticipated that there will be an interim data analysis at 150 evaluable subjects for assessment of the dose response to morphine in the overall population; then a final analysis at 300 subjects for the genetic effect assessment.

"NCT05001854 Evaluation of the Hemodynamics Effects of Fludrocortisone on the Pressor Response to Noradrenaline in Septic Shock Patients The benefit of low-dose steroids in septic shock is still debated today, especially with mineralocorticoids. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid, an analogue of aldosterone, which has shown, in combination with hydrocortisone, a favorable effect on the mortality of septic shock patients with relative adrenal insufficiency. In a previous study in healthy volunteers, we showed for the first time that fludrocortisone at a dose of 400 μg per day significantly improved the pressor response to phenylephrine. These results confirm the observations reported in rats with endotoxin shock, where fludrocortisone was shown to significantly increase blood pressure and contractile response to phenylephrine. These encouraging results argue for a potential vascular beneficial effect of fludrocortisone and need to be confirmed in a population of septic shock patients. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the effect of oral administration of 100 μg every 6 hours of fludrocortisone on vascular responsiveness to noradrenaline in septic shock patients.

"NCT01976988 PROSPECTIVE STUDY ON PREOPERATIVE VERSUS POSTOPERATIVE VENOUS THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING MAJOR COLORECTAL SURGERY Patients undergoing major colorectal surgery are at increased risk for VTE (deep venous thrombosis) compared with patients undergoing other general surgical procedures (Bergqvist et al. Dis. Col. Rectum. 2006; 49: 1620-1628.)~The reported incidence of symptomatic VTE after colorectal surgery is approximately 4% (Monn, F. et al. JACS. 216; 2013: 395-401). However, the reported incidence of VTE after colorectal surgery in prospectively followed patients managed with perioperative venous thromboprophylaxis undergoing screening venography prior to hospital discharge ranges from 9 to 20% (Bergovist et al. NEJM 346; 2002: 975-980; McLeod et al. Ann. Surg. 233; 2000: 438-444; ENOXACAN Study group. Brit. J. Surg. 84; 1997: 1099-1103.~The Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) and the American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) guidelines recommend that venous thromboprophylaxis be initiated within 24 hours of surgery. However, it is believed that deep venous thrombosis occurs during surgery, rather than in the postoperative period, justifying preoperative initiation of venous thromboprophylaxis. This practice is accompanied with a theoretically higher risk of bleeding complications.~Currently there is no consensus on the precise timing of VTE prophylaxis after major colorectal surgery, as demonstrated by the vague guidelines established by the ACCP and SCIP. Current studies on VTE prophylaxis report preoperative initiation of VTE prophylaxis. However, majority of surgeons at our institution begin heparin postoperatively given concern for bleeding complications with preoperative dosing of heparin.~The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the incidence of VTE and major bleeding complications in patients undergoing major colorectal surgery who are treated with preoperative or postoperative venous thromboprophylaxis and to help establish more stringent guidelines on the optimal timing of VTE prophylaxis.

"NCT05301530 Randomized, Single-blind, Multicenter, Parallel Group Clinical Trial to Assess Pharmacokinetic Parameters, Safety of NNG-TMAB (Trastuzumab) in Combination With Docetaxel on Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With Positive HER2. Targeted therapy in the treatment of breast cancer targets HER2 receptor (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor). HER2 receptor plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation (5). However, when HER2 overexpresses, it may lead to cancer. HER2 positive malignance exacerbates pathology and worsens clinical outcome, such as shortened overall survival (OS) compared with non-HER2 overexpression patients (6), (7). About 20-30% overexpression HER2/neogene breast cancer patients and patients having HER2 overexpression tumor have disease progression and poor prognosis in metastatic process (8), (9).~Currently, targeted therapeutic, which attaches to the HER2 receptor, inhibiting the growth of cancer cells has been approved.

"NCT00869206 A Randomized, Phase III Study of Standard Dosing Versus Longer Dosing Interval of Zoledronic Acid in Metastatic Cancer This randomized phase III trial studies two different schedules of zoledronic acid to compare how well they work in reducing bone-related complications in patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma that has spread to other places in the body and have bone involvement. Bone-related complications are a major cause of morbidity in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, breast cancer, and multiple myeloma.

"NCT02130804 Using Salsalate to Target Adipocyte Macrophage Infiltration and Reverse Metabolic Disease Risk in Obese Hispanic Young Adults Background: The prevalence of obesity has increased throughout the last three decades due to genetic, metabolic, behavioral, and environmental factors. Obesity and high-fat western diets activate inflammatory processes, which promote development of insulin resistance as well as other metabolic complications. Increasing obesity rates are a major public health concern in the Hispanic population due to the large number of Hispanics suffering from obesity. Based on preliminary data, we propose a double-blind randomized clinical trial of Salsalate therapy in obese Hispanic young adults. Salsalate treatment shows promise for decreasing inflammation under conditions of weight stability by reducing macrophage infiltration of adipocytes. Hispanics have the greatest amount of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), liver fat, and inflammation when compared to other ethnic groups, thereby increasing the potential for treatment effects in this high-risk population.~Purpose: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate through a proof-of-concept trial that Salsalate induced reductions in adipose tissue inflammation are possible under conditions of weight stability.~Methodology: We will recruit obese Hispanic young adults (18 - 35 years) from hospitals, clinics, and community centers. Study Endpoints: Primary outcomes will be macrophage infiltration as assessed by the presence of crown-like structures (CLS) in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) biopsies, liver fat, insulin sensitivity, and fasting glucose. We will also assess plasma levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1, C-reactive protein (CRP), and SAT gene expression of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and insulin signaling pathways.~Intervention and Follow-up: Participants will be randomly assigned to four weeks of treatment with Salsalate (4 g/d) or placebo and will be studied under weight maintenance conditions. These measures will enable us to determine if Salsalate treatment is capable of reducing adipose tissue inflammation and related metabolic outcomes in the absence of weight loss.

"NCT00372216 CIPAMI-Study: Clopidogrel Administered Prehospital to Improve Primary PCI in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction Acute myocardial infarction is generally caused by a thrombotic occlusion of coronary arteries. Primary aim of early therapy is a fast and complete reperfusion of the infarcted myocardium, which can be achieved by either thrombolytic therapy or primary PCI.~Primary PCI is facilitated if the flow in the target vessel is restored prior to the intervention. In addition the results of recent trials hint that clinical outcome is improved by a patent infarct-vessel before primary PCI. The CIPAMI-study analyses the effect of an early administration of Clopidogrel on the flow-rates in subjects who suffered an acute myocardial infarction. For this purpose they are divided into two groups, both receiving standard baseline treatment. The subjects of one group additionally receive 600mg of Clopidogrel, as early as possible, while the subjects in the second group receive standard therapy. In the second group Clopidogrel is not allowed before initial angiography.~In both groups the flow-rates before and after PCI are analysed and compared in order to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of the administration of a high loading dose Clopidogrel in the very early phase of STEMI in the prehospital setting.

The current regimen recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for cesarean delivery prophylaxis (1st generation cephalosporins) does not cover for Ureaplasma Urealyticum, a microorganism that has been associated with an increased risk of endometritis in post-cesarean section patients. Azithromycin, an antibiotic that has both aerobic and some anaerobic coverage, uniquely covers Ureaplasma and would be an excellent second antibiotic for cesarean section chemoprophylaxis. Our hypothesis is that the addition of azithromycin to standard chemoprophylaxis with cefazolin can effect a 25% reduction of post-cesarean section endometritis. Female N/A N/A Inclusion Criteria:~Pregnant patients between 37 and 42 weeks gestational weeks.~Pregnant patients undergoing indicated cesarean section at Truman Medical Center Hospital July 2012 and July 2014.~Pregnant patient that received prenatal care at Truman Medical Center.

"NCT04612920 Towards Enhanced Recovery After Cesarean: Scheduled Post-operative Medication: a Randomized Controlled Trial One in 300 women will become persistent opioid users after cesarean delivery (1). Cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure in the United States, representing 31.9% of the 3,788,235 deliveries in 2018 (2). Patients have to cope with the pain and challenges of post-operative care while adjusting to motherhood and completing activities of daily living. Often when they return home, they are also tasked with other domestic roles which compounds the challenge of this post-operative period. With a potential impact just in the US on 1.2 million mothers each year, optimizing post-operative pain management in order to reduce the risk of persistent opioid use represents an urgent unmet public health goal. To this end, there are national efforts to reduce the cesarean rate and optimize post-cesarean pain management (3,4). The majority of efforts in the last few years have focused on home-going medications and alterations in prescription practices. Recent recommendations from the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society indicate that patients should receive multi-modal analgesia on a regular basis, along with early post-delivery mobilization (3). However, the efficacy of scheduled non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAID) along with acetaminophen in the immediate post-operative period and after going home have not been systematically studied in the cesarean population. We hypothesize that patients who receive scheduled medications in the post-operative period are less likely to require opioids for pain relief both in the hospital and after they return home. Female 18 Years 50 Years Inclusion Criteria:~Undergoing repeat cesarean delivery~≥37 week gestation~attended at least 7 prenatal visits~age ≥18.~Exclusion Criteria:~Non-English speaking, attended < 7 prenatal visits, fetal anomalies or death, inability to ambulate, BMI ≥45kg/m2 at delivery due to higher risk of regional analgesia complications, placental implantation abnormalities, maternal diabetes due to the risk of wound complications, chorioamnionitis, allergy to study medications, underlying renal or hepatic impairment, opioid use in the last 3 months, chronic controlled substance use, chronic pain disorders, history of narcotic addiction, intraoperative hemorrhage not controlled with medication alone, additional concurrent surgeries other than sterilization procedures and presence of endometriosis noted at time of surgery.

"NCT03066466 Randomized Study of Atorvastatin Prophylaxis as a Supplement to Standard of Care Prophylaxis to Prevent Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation From Matched Unrelated Donors Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) is one of the most challenging complications in long term survivors of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. As the number of allogeneic stem cell transplantations rises annually, the incidence of chronic GVHD rates have also increased due to a variety of factors including but not limited to increasing use of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts, increasing age of both donors and recipients, and increased use of matched unrelated donors. One study showed much lower than traditional acute GHVD rate and chronic GHVD which is similar with historical rates when atorvastatin was administered prophylactically to both the donors as well as recipients of matched related allogeneic stem cell transplantation, lead to the interest in further examining the role of Atorvastatin in relation to the development of GVHD. The investigator hypothesize that the administration of atorvastatin in recipients of matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation, a group with known higher incidence of chronic GHVD, would be a safe and effective method to reduce the incidence of chronic GVHD. Matched related allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients will not be included in this study due to their significantly lower GVHD rates. The definition and monitoring of our primary endpoint of GVHD is well established in clinical trials in allogeneic stem cell transplantations and the investiagor will utilize the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Staging System for the diagnosis and severity assessment of chronic GVHD as well the recommendations from the NIH Consensus Conference for the conduct of clinical trials in chronic GVHD.~Several secondary endpoints will be examined as defined below and include standard complementary data in the examination of clinical trials in chronic GVHD again as laid out by the NIH Consensus Conference for conduct of clinical trials in chronic GHVD.

"NCT05289869 The HILIO Trial: High vs. Low Oxytocin Dosing for Induction of Labor in Pregnant Patients With Obesity- PILOT STUDY Pregnant patients with obesity are more likely to undergo induction of labor and have a higher risk of failed induction compared to patients with normal weight. The association between maternal obesity and labor dysfunction leading to cesarean delivery is poorly understood. Oxytocin is the mostly common medication used in induction of labor, yet optimal dosing of this medication is unknown. Studies have suggested that patients with obesity may be less responsive to oxytocin. This trial will compare a high and low dose oxytocin dosing regimen for the induction of labor in women with obesity. Female 18 Years 50 Years Inclusion Criteria:~Nulliparity~Maternal age >18 years~Gestational age ≥37w0d~Induction of labor, defined as initiation of labor with medication or intracervical Foley catheter in a patient without observed spontaneous cervical change and <6 contractions per hour (average of one contraction every 10 minutes) at the time of initial presentation.

"NCT03595982 Is Procardia XL 60 mg Q Daily Equivalent to 30 mg XL Given Twice Daily? Antihypertensive therapy has been used in pregnant patients antepartum to improve blood pressure (BP) elevation in cases of chronic hypertension, and postpartum for persistent hypertension after delivery in cases of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, as well as for management of chronic hypertension.~There is limited evidence regarding the precise BP level at which antihypertensive therapy is indicated during pregnancy for chronic hypertension. Treatment has been suggested in pregnant patients when systolic BP is ≥ 160 mmHg and at a lower diastolic BP threshold of 105 mm Hg, however some providers may initiate therapy at systolic BPs ≥ 150 mmHg.~Nifedipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator and an ideal first line antihypertensive agent due to its low maternal side-effect profile. It has been proven to be safe in pregnancy. Conventional nifedipine can be started at 10 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 120 mg/d, but frequently extended release tablets are preferred due to steady blood pressure control with once daily administration.~It is frequently used however as a twice daily dosing as many providers have noticed an increase in the BPs 12-24h from administration. Twice daily dosing might produce overlapping profiles that prevent elevation of BP at the time of the next administration and breakthrough elevations throughout the day in pregnant women.~The aim of this study is to investigate the mean plasma levels and standard deviations of Procardia at 24h after Procardia XL is administered as a 60 mg daily dose and the mean plasma levels after it is given as a 30 mg twice-daily dose. This will be a pilot study for a future randomized control trial that will allow the researchers to determine whether 60 mg daily of Procardia XL is equivalent to 30 mg twice daily. Secondary outcome will be effective control of BP throughout the day (0h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h, 20h and 24h) defined as BPs below 160/105 as well as side effects of nifedipine as reported by patients. Female 18 Years 55 Years Inclusion Criteria:~Antepartum or postpartum patients between the age of 18-55 requiring 60 mg of Procardia XL to control elevated blood pressures secondary to preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or chronic hypertension.~Exclusion Criteria:~All patients receiving other antihypertensive medication~All patients with a contraindication to nifedipine: Hypersensitivity to nifedipine or other calcium -channel blocker, cardiogenic shock, concomitant administration with strong CYP34A inducers (rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St Johns Wort) → significantly reduces nifedipine efficacy, impaired liver function→?

"NCT00840216 A Randomized, Two-Way Crossover, Single-Dose, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Relative Bioavailability of a Test Extended Release Tablet Formulation of Clarithromycin (500 mg), Compared to an Equivalent Dose of a Commercially Available Reference Drug Product (Biaxin® XL Filmtab) in 22 Fed, Healthy, Adult Subjects The objective of this study is to compare the relative bioequivalence of a test clarithromycin extended release formulation to an equivalent oral dose of the commercially available extended release clarithromycin in a test population of 22 adult subjects under fed conditions. All 18 Years N/A Inclusion Criteria~Sex: Males or females who are surgically sterile or have been post-menopausal for at least 6 months; similar proportions of each preferred.~Age: At least 18 years.~Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by medical history, complete physical examination, and laboratory tests, all obtained within four (4) weeks prior to study start. The subjects may not have a history of significant past illness expected to affect the investigation. The normal status of subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures:~Laboratory Tests:~Hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, differential count, serum electrolytes (Nz, K, Cl), fasting blood glucose, BUN, bilirubin,m creatinine, AST, ALT, LD, alkaline phosphatase and urinalysis. HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of abuse testing will be done for screening purposes only. Urine drugs of abuse testing will be repeated at each check-in. Female subjects will have a serum pregnancy test done at screening and a urine pregnancy test prior to each study period at check-in. Post-menopausal females will have an FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) level performed to confirm post-menopausal status.~Laboratory values which are greater than ±20% of the normal range will not qualify unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the Principal Investigator. Results of HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of abuse must be negative or non-reactive for the subject to qualify for the study.~Electrocardiogram~A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all subjects. The original tracings, plus interpretation, will be included in the case report form packet.~Subjects must read and sign the Consent Form.~Exclusion Criteria~Subjects not complying with the above inclusion criteria must be excluded from the study.~In addition, any one of the conditions listed below will exclude a subject from the study:~History of treatment for alcoholism, substance abuse, or drug abuse within past 24 months.~History of malignancy, stroke, diabetes, cardiac, renal or liver disease, or other serious illness.~History of treatment for any gastrointestinal disorder within the past 5 years.~History of treatment for asthma within the past five (5) years.~History of diarrhea within 24 hours prior to dosing.~Females who are pregnant or lactating.~History of hypersensitivity to clarithromycin or any macrolide antibiotic.~Conditions upon screening which might contraindicate or require that caution be used in the administration of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride, including:~Sitting systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure below 50 mm Hg.~Heart rate less than 50 beats per minute after a 5-minute rest in a seated position.~Inability to read and/or sign the consent form.~Treatment with any other investigational drug during the four (4) weeks prior to the initial dosing for this study.~Subjects who have donated blood within four (4) weeks prior to the initial dosing for this study.~Subjects who smoke or use tobacco products or are currently using nicotine products (patches, gums, etc.).

"NCT05359653 A Randomized, Double-Blind, Delayed Treatment, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Assess the Changes in Multi-parametric MRI in MS Patients Taking Clemastine Fumarate as a Myelin Repair Therapy The clinical trial is intended to assess for clinical evidence of Clemastine Fumarate as a myelin repair therapy in patients with chronic inflammatory injury-causing demyelination as measured by multi-parametric MRI assessments.~No reparative therapies exist for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Clemastine fumarate was identified along with a series of other antimuscarinic medications as a potential remyelinating agent using the micropillar screen (BIMA) developed at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Following in vivo validation, an FDA IND exemption was granted to investigate clemastine for the treatment of multiple sclerosis in the context of chronic optic neuropathy. That pilot study was recently completed and is the first randomized control trial documenting efficacy for a putative remyelinating agent for the treatment of MS. The preselected primary efficacy endpoint (visual evoked potential) was met and a strong trend to benefit was seen for the principal secondary endpoint assessing function (low contrast visual acuity). That trial number was 13-11577.~This study seeks to follow up on that study and examine clemastine fumarate's protective and reparative effects in the context of chronic demyelinating brain lesions as imaged by multi-parametric MRI assessments. The investigators will be assessing the effects of clemastine fumarate as a remyelinating therapy and assessing its effect on MRI metrics of chronic lesions found in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.~In addition to using conventional multi-parametric MRI assessments, this study will also evaluate a new MRI technique called Ultrashort Echo Time (UTE) MRI to assess the effects of clemastine fumarate as a remyelinating therapy of chronic lesions found in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and compare it to the other assessments.

"NCT02921256 A Phase II Clinical Trial Platform of Sensitization Utilizing Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (TNT) in Rectal Cancer This randomized phase II trial studies how well veliparib or pembrolizumab work with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with rectal cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced). Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as modified (m)FOLFOX6 regimen, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving veliparib or pembrolizumab with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells, make the tumor smaller, and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

"NCT03376854 Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial of Therapeutic Hypothermia Plus Neuromuscular Blockade vs. Standard of Care in COVID-19 Patients With Moderate to Severe ARDS - the Cooling to Help Injured Lungs (CHILL) Pilot Study Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a serious condition that occurs as a complication of medical and surgical diseases, has a mortality of ~40%, and has no known treatment other than optimization of support. Data from basic research, animal models, and retrospective studies, case series, and small prospective studies suggest that therapeutic hypothermia (TH) similar to that used for cardiac arrest may be lung protective in patients with ARDS; however, shivering is a major complication of TH, often requiring paralysis with neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) to control. Since the recently completed NHLBI PETAL ROSE trial showed that NMBA had no effect (good or bad) in patients with moderate to severe ARDS, the investigators sought to evaluate whether TH combined with NMBA is beneficial in patients with ARDS. The investigators are scheduled to begin enrolling in a Department of Defense-funded Phase IIb multicenter RCT of TH (core temperature 34-35°C) + NMBA for 48h vs. usual temperature management in patients with ARDS with time on ventilator as the primary outcome. Since COVID-19 is now the most common cause of ARDS, we are conducting a pilot study to examine the safety and feasibility of including patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS in our upcoming trial. In this pilot, we will randomize 20 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS to either TH+NMBA for 48h or usual temperature management. The primary outcome is achieving and maintaining the target temperature.

"NCT02514642 Safety and Efficacy of Low-dose Ticagrelor in Chinese Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease: a Randomized, Single-blind, Crossover Clinical Trial Ticagrelor is an oral, reversibly-binding, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist used clinically for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Guideline recommendations on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) have been formulated that ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin in preference to clopidogrel 75mg daily plus aspirin for patients who have an ACS with or without ST-segment elevation. However, few East Asian patients (or those of East Asian descent) have been included in these trials to assess the use of these drugs. In Korea and Japan, it has been reported that low doses of ticagrelor might have a more potent inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) than clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) in healthy subjects and patients with stable coronary artery disease, respectively. But it is still not clear whether a low dose of ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel in a large population of Chinese ACS patients. A recent study on pharmacokinetics and tolerability of ticagrelor has found that maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) and its active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) tended to be approximately 40% higher in healthy Chinese volunteers compared with Caucasian subjects. This data also suggested that a low dose of ticagrelor might be more appropriate for Chinese ACS patients. In view of a large diurnal variation with a single daily dose, a lower dose twice daily may be a better choice for Chinese patients. Therefore, the investigators performed this randomized, single-blind, crossover clinical trial to observe the efficacy and safety of low-dose ticagrelor (22.5 mg twice daily) in comparison to clopidogrel (75mg once daily) in Chinese patients with stable coronary artery disease.

"NCT01346774 Phase II Efficacy of Cranberry Powder in Preventing Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infection Post Elective Gynecological Surgery Approximately 10-27% of patients undergoing gynecologic surgeries develop a catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in the post operatory period, as bladder catheterization is a common practice in gynecologic surgery. Cranberry products provide alternative means for preventing CAUTI and could result in decreased use of antimicrobials. In this pilot study we will enroll 200 women post gynecologic surgery and randomize them to take either cranberry powder capsules or placebo powder capsules. The low risk of harm associated with using cranberry to reduce UTI coupled with its potential benefit makes it a desirable intervention for the prevention of CAUTI. The conduct/ results of this pilot /feasibility study will prepare us for the conduct of a large scale clinical trial. Female 18 Years N/A Inclusion Criteria:~Presenting at the gynecology clinic for a pre-operatory visit~Ability to give informed consent~Willing to take cranberry capsules for up to 6 weeks~18 of age or older~Exclusion Criteria:~Pregnancy~History of nephrolithiasis~History of allergy to cranberry~Patient on anticoagulant medicine to be re-started during the 4-6 weeks after surgery~Less than 18 years old urinary tract infection"

"NCT03571334 Botulinum Toxin A for the Treatment of Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of taxanes and platinum derivative based chemotherapeutic agents, common in breast cancer treatment regimens. It can have a significant effect on both quality of life and treatment outcomes, often resulting in dose modifications and early treatment discontinuation. The use of IncobotulinumtoxinA (INA) ((Xeomin®, Merz) has recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain via inhibiting the release of several neurotransmitters involved in pain signaling pathway.~The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of intradermal INA injections for treatment of CIPN in breast cancer patients. The study will recruit a total of 40 participants, randomly assigned to receive either INA (Experimental group, n=20) or saline placebo injections (Control group n=20).~Potential participants who have received chemotherapy for breast cancer will be screened for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. After obtaining informed consent, participants will be further screened with the DN4 questionnaire, a clinician administered questionnaire that has a high level of sensitivity and specificity in discriminating neuropathic pain. Those study participants who score ≥4 on this tool will undergo nerve conduction studies to confirm the presence of peripheral neuropathy. Recruited study participants will then be randomized to treatment or control groups; the treatment group will undergo intradermal injections of INA (100 Units INA, total volume 5ml), and the control groups will undergo placebo injection with preservative-free normal saline (equal volume, 5mL). Total injection volume will be divided evenly and injected intradermally into a total of 50 sites on either the feet or hands (25 sites per limb).~The primary outcome will be the assessment of pain using the neuropathic pain scale (NPS) prior to intervention and at eight weeks post intervention. Secondary outcomes will include the change in NPS for each domain at additional time points: 2weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, the change in the Neuropathic Pain Impact on Quality of Life (NePIQoL) score at time points: 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and the incidence of treatment related adverse events within each cohort. Statistical analysis will be utilized to determine whether the injection of intradermal INA is effective in improving pain as measured by the NPS scales vs placebo.~We hypothesize that the study participants treated with INA will have lower NPS scores as compared to placebo. All 18 Years N/A Inclusion Criteria:~Been diagnosed with breast cancer and undergone treatment with taxane based chemotherapeutic agents.

"NCT00486902 Does a Single Intravenous Dose of Ketamine Reduce the Need for Supplemental Opioids in Post-Cesarean Section Patients? Pain control after cesarean delivery is associated with improved breastfeeding and infant rooming-in times. In addition, inadequate analgesia leads to elevated plasma catecholamine concentrations, which negatively affect every organ system. There is growing evidence that ketamine, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, is efficacious when used as an adjuvant in postoperative pain control. A 2006 Cochrane Collaboration systemic review and meta-analysis concluded, Ketamine in subanesthetic doses….is effective in reducing morphine requirements in the first 24 hours after surgery.~Ketamine's prolonged analgesic effect, despite its short half-life and its use in low doses, is theorized to be due to blockade of spinal cord central sensitization. Central sensitization is a phenomenon whereby repeated painful stimulus leads to more severe pain perception over time despite no change in the intensity of the painful stimulus.Ketamine may also prevent the development of acute opioid tolerance. Ketamine's analgesic effects have also demonstrated in the obstetric population. Post-cesarean delivery morphine requirements in women who received ketamine as part of a general anesthesia technique were decreased. Similary, low-dose ketamine in conjunction with bupivacaine-only spinal anesthesia reduced postoperative analgesic requirements compared to bupivacaine-only spinal anesthesia and bupivacaine-fentanyl spinal anesthesia.~In the United States, healthy women scheduled for elective cesarean delivery commonly receive spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine-fentanyl-morphine. To our knowledge, IV ketamine has not been studied as an adjuvant to this regimen in the analgesic management in post-cesarean delivery patients. Multimodal therapy for postoperative pain control is widely practiced due to the advantage it provides in blocking multiple pain pathways while minimizing side effects of each individual pain medication. We hypothesize that low dose intravenous ketamine will improve multi-modal post-cesarean analgesia compared to placebo. The purpose of this study is to evaluate this hypothesis and study the possible side effects of this regimen in combination with bupivacaine-fentanyl-morphine spinal anesthesia. Female 18 Years 60 Years Inclusion Criteria:~Eligible women are at term (≥37 week gestation),~Healthy,~ASA class 1-2,~Scheduled for elective cesarean section whose anesthetic plan is for spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine and intravenous ketorolac analgesia for post operative analgesia~Exclusion Criteria:~Women with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status >2,~Body mass index ≥40 kg/m2,~Known allergy to any of the study medications,~Contraindication to the spinal anesthesia,~History of substance abuse,~History of hallucinations,~Chronic opioid therapy,~Chronic pain. ketamine adverse reaction~effects of; anesthesia, spinal and epidural, in pregnancy~complication of labor and/or delivery"
"NCT03687827 A Randomised, Cross-over, Open-label, Multi-centre Trial Comparing the Effect of Insulin Degludec and Insulin Glargine 100U/mL, With or Without OADs in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Using Flash Glucose Monitoring This study compares the effect on blood sugar levels of two medicines: insulin degludec and insulin glargine in people with type 2 diabetes. Participants will be treated with insulin degludec and insulin glargine during two different periods. Which treatment participants get first is decided by chance. Both medicines are approved for use in humans and available on the market. They can already be prescribed by participants' doctors. Participants will get pre-filled insulin pens to inject these insulins with. The study will last for about 41 weeks. Participants will visit the clinic 13 times and have 27 phone calls with the study doctor or study staff. At 12 of the clinic visits they will take blood samples. In order to evaluate the changes in participants' blood sugar level over time, participants will be asked to wear a small (35 millimetres (mm) x 5 mm) sensor on the back of participants' upper arm 3 times during the study. Each time participants must wear the sensor for 2 weeks. This sensor is called FreeStyle Libre Pro®. It has a very small tip which is 0.4 mm thick and is inserted 5 mm under participants' skin. Please note that participants will not be able to see the sensor readings while wearing it. The study doctor will show participants the readings when participants return to the clinic. Participants will be asked to fill in a diary in between visits. Participants will have contact with the study doctor or study staff each week. This is to adjust the dose of participants' study medicines and to ensure that participants are well. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period.
