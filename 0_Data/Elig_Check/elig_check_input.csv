Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with Sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP), the administration of SP at predefined intervals in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy irrespective of the presence of malaria parasitemia, is currently recommended for HIV-negative women in all areas with stable moderate to high transmission of malaria. Due to increasing resistance to SP, it is no longer used as a treatment for symptomatic malaria, and the efficacy of IPTp-SP seems to be decreased. This study aims to look at a new drug, Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) for IPTp, as well as to explore the strategy of intermittent screening and treatment in pregnancy (ISTp) with DP. This strategy uses increased screening at time of focused antenatal care (FANC) with treatment of women who screen positive.~The hypothesis is that the efficacy of both IPTp-DP and ISTp-DP will be associated with a reduction in malaria infection at delivery among HIV(-) women when compared to IPTp-SP, in an area with decreasing malaria transmission and high levels of SP resistance in Kenya._Female_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Viable pregnancy assessed by Doppler~Gestational age 16 to 32 weeks (inclusive) by fundal height~No history of IPTp use during this pregnancy~Willing to participate and complete the study schedule~Willing to sign or thumb print informed consent~Resident of study area and intending to stay in the area for the duration of the follow-up~Willing to deliver in the labor ward of the study clinic or hospital~HIV negative at enrolment~Exclusion Criteria:~HIV positive or unknown~Residence outside study area or planning to move out in the 12 months following enrolment~High risk pregnancy, including any pre-existing illness likely to cause complication of pregnancy (hypertension, diabetes, asthma, epilepsy, renal disease, liver disease, fistula repair, leg or spine deformity)~Severe anemia requiring blood transfusion (Hb ≤ 7.0 g/dL) at enrolment~Known allergy or previous adverse reaction to any of the study drugs~Unable to give informed consent (for example due to mental disability)~Previous inclusion in the same study~Gestational age >32 weeks~Previous IPTp during the current pregnancy~Participating in other malaria intervention studies~Known or suspected cardiac disease~Patients taking drugs in any of the following classes: antiarrhythmic agents, neuroleptics, macrolides, and certain antimalarial drugs such as mefloquine, chloroquine, halofantrine and lumefantrine."

Tepotinib is used in patients whose cancer has a mutated (changed) form of a gene called MET. It is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal MET protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of tumor cells.

"48","NCT02434952_The Tolerability and Safety of Low Dose Primaquine for Transmission Blocking in Symptomatic Falciparum Infected Cambodians_In Cambodia, falciparum is becoming more difficult to treat because drugs are becoming less effective. The investigators can help to try to prevent the spread of this resistant malaria by adding a drug that will make it more difficult for the mosquito to drink up the malaria in people's blood. If the mosquito cannot drink up the malaria, then the malaria cannot develop in the mosquito so it will not be able to inject malaria back into people when it bites. The drug the investigators will use is called primaquine.~Primaquine commonly causes the red cells in the blood to break apart if they are weak. Red cells need enzymes to work properly and weak red cells have low amounts of an enzyme called glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The investigators want to know if treating malaria with primaquine will be safe for the red cells. To do this study, the investigators need to know if a subject has low G6PD or not._All_1 Year_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Age ≥ 1 year~Presentation with a confirmed fever (≥ 38⁰C axilla or ≥ 37.5⁰C aural) or history of fever in previous 48 hours +/- other clinical features of uncomplicated malaria~Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection ≥ 1 asexual form / 500 white blood cells~Informed consent (written/verbal) provided by patient or relative/legal guardian~Signed Assent form for children aged 12 to < 18 years~Exclusion Criteria:~Clinical signs of severe malaria or danger signs~Pregnant or breast feeding~Unable or unwilling to take a pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing age)~Women intending to become pregnant in the next 3 months~Allergic to primaquine or DHA PP~Patients taking drugs known to cause acute intravascular haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) in G6PD deficiency e.g. dapsone, nalidixic acid~Patients on treatment for a significant illness e.g. HIV, tuberculosis (TB) treatment, steroids~On drugs that could interfere with anti-malarial pharmacokinetics like antiretrovirals, cimetidine, ketoconazole, antiepileptic drugs, rifampicin"

"55","NCT01810354_PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS PRIOR TO CESAREAN SECTION IN OBESE WOMEN: Does Increasing the Dose Increase the Tissue Concentration?_Surgical site infections are common and a cause of major morbidity. They are also more common in obese women. Cesarean sections are the most common surgery performed in the United States, therefore pregnant women are being faced with this problem frequently. There is evidence to show that prophylactically administered antibiotics, cefazolin specifically, to obese women prior to cesarean section do not reach adequate concentrations in adipose tissue to prevent infection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if an increased dose of cefazolin will attain adequate tissue concentration in obese women. Our hypothesis is that three grams of cefazolin given no more than 60 minutes prior to the start of a cesarean section in an obese (Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30) woman will attain adequate adipose tissue concentration compared to two grams of cefazolin.~Subjects will be selected if they are greater than 37 weeks gestation wiht a singleton pregnancy and require a cesarean section for any obstetrical indication. Women will be excluded if they have a suspected infection, have a multiple gestation, or have preexisting diabetes or hypertension with end organ damage. The subjects will be screened both by through the OR schedule as well as through the clinics. They will then be consented and enrolled by the primary investigator. Once enrolled the subjects will be randomized to receive either two grams or three grams of cefazolin as prophylactic antibiotics to be given no more than 60 minutes prior to the start of the surgery.~Two adipose tissue samples will be obtained at the time of surgery. The first at the start after skin incision and the second at the end prior to closure of the skin. There will also be a separate IV placed at the start of the procedure from which three blood draws can be collected. These three samples will be obtained at the start of the surgery but after antibiotic administration, at the time of the first adipose collection, and at the time of the second adipose collection. The samples will then be stored at -80 degrees and shipped to David P. Nicolau's lab in Hartford, CT for the tissue and serum analysis.~While the subjects are in the hospital recovering from their surgery, a chart review will be performed to determine if there are any infections occuring post-operatively. A telephone survey will be conducted six to eight weeks postpartum again assessing for any infectious complications after the cesarean section._Female_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Obese - body mass index (BMI) calculated as weight (kg)/ [height (m2)]greater than or equal to 30 as determined at their first prenatal visit~Gestational age of 37 0/7 weeks and greater~Singleton Pregnancy~Non-emergent cesarean section~Exclusion Criteria:~Known cephalosporin allergy~Severe allergy to penicillin making cephalosporin use a contraindication~Exposure to antibiotics in the preceding 7 days~Need for emergent cesarean section~Multiple gestations~Suspected chorioamnionitis~Pre-gestational diabetes~Chronic hypertension with evidence of end organ damage"

Current anti-rejection medicines are not completely effective in preventing rejection. This trial will test how well Thymoglobulin, Tacrolimus, and Sirolimus work together post-transplant and if the treatment can be reduced over time to control rejection with either Tacrolimus or Sirolimus alone.~Candidates for kidney transplantation at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center may participate in this 5-year study. Patients will be screened for eligibility with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests.~Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:~Central line placement: A large intravenous catheter (plastic tube, or IV line) is placed in a vein in the chest or neck under local anesthesia before the transplant surgery. The line remains in place for some time during the hospitalization to administer Thymoglobulin, antibiotics, and blood, if needed. The line is also used to collect blood samples.~Leukapheresis: This procedure for collecting white blood cells is done before the transplant. The cells are studied to evaluate the patient's immune system. Whole blood is withdrawn through a catheter in an arm vein or through the central line and directed into a machine that separates the blood components by spinning. The white cells are removed and the red cells and plasma are returned to the body.~Kidney transplant: Patients undergo kidney transplant surgery under general anesthesia.~Immunosuppressive therapy: Patients receive thymoglobulin by vein for 4 days starting 1 day before the transplant. They also take Tylenol, Benadryl and a steroid (methylprednisolone) to help reduce the side effects of the Thymoglobulin. After the transplant, patients receive Tacrolimus and Sirolimus by mouth once a day for 6 months and then either Tacrolimus or Sirolimus alone indefinitely. In addition, they take medicines to help prevent viral and fungal infections for 6 months because the immunosuppressive therapy leaves them vulnerable to infection.~Follow-up visits: After hospital discharge, patients return to the Clinical Center twice a week for 4 weeks, then every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly for another 4 years. At each visit, the patient's vital signs are checked and blood and urine samples are collected. Periodically, patients are also questioned about how they feel and how the transplant has affected their quality of life. Kidney biopsies (removal of a small amount of kidney tissue through a thin needle) are done when the patient begins single-drug immunosuppression (generally 6 months after transplantation) and 1 year after that. The biopsied tissue is examined to evaluate how well the kidney is responding to the treatment and to determine how to proceed with therapy.~Routine laboratory tests: Routine tests, coordinated by the patient's local physician, are done 2 to 3 times a week for the first 2 to 3 months after transplantation, then weekly for several more months, and at least monthly for life._All_N/A_N/A_INCLUSION CRITERIA:~Candidates for a kidney transplant at the Clinical Center.~Willingness and legal ability to give informed consent.~Availability of donor tissue for testing. This could include splenic or peripheral blood lymphocytes from a cadaveric donor or a willing living donor who consents to periodic phlebotomy for peripheral blood lymphocyte isolation.~EXCLUSION CRITERIA:~Immunosuppressive drug therapy at the time of or 2 months prior to enrollment. Specifically, candidates may not be taking prednisone, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, anti-lymphocyte agents, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, or other agents whose therapeutic effect is immunosuppressive.~Any active malignancy or any history of any hematogenous malignancy or lymphoma.

"73","NCT00707941_Efficacy of Oseltamivir in Reducing the Duration of Clinical Illness, Viral Shedding, and Transmissibility Reduction Within Households Among Participants in an Influenza Disease Burden Surveillance Cohort in Urban Dhaka, Bangladesh_Background In preparation for a global influenza pandemic, there is an urgent need for representative data from populations and settings where the pandemic is most likely to arise. There are no data on oseltamivir efficacy from Asian urban slum populations concerning duration of illness and viral shedding, nor whether efficacy depends on starting treatment < 48 hours or ≥ 48 hours after illness onset. Finally, there are no data on the capacity of the drug, in such settings, to affect household and community transmission rates.~Aims and Objectives This proposal aims to compare the duration of clinical illness among patients treated with oseltamivir vs placebo < 48 hours and ≥ 48 hours after illness onset. It will compare the duration of viral shedding among all treatment groups vs placebo, risk of transmission to household contacts by treatment group and whether neuraminidase inhibitor use creates resistance. Secondarily it aims to measure the effect on influenza.~Design and Methods A double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial design among a population in an urban slum under current influenza disease burden surveillance will be enrolled. Infection status will be confirmed by rRT-PCR. Patients ≥ 1 year old will be randomised to < 48 hour and ≥ 48 hour treatment arms. Family members and neighbours will also be assessed by PCR and a basic reproductive number calculated (R0).~Relevance These findings will address whether oseltamivir can affect illness duration and severity, affect transmission, incidence and resistance in high risk urban Asian settings where a pandemic is most likely to arise._All_1 Year_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Persons at least one year old residing in randomly selected households with at least one major illness sign, or if absent at least two minor illness signs who are rapid test positive for either influenza A or influenza B.~Exclusion Criteria:~Persons with a history of non-febrile convulsions or~Persons who are taking anticonvulsive agents, or~Persons who have a nonrespiratory comorbid condition requiring immediate medical intervention, or~Persons who are pregnant."

"77","NCT02129348_Treatment of Psychosis and Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease_Clinically, many patients with AD show no response or minimal response to antipsychotics for symptoms of agitation/aggression or psychosis, or they have intolerable side effects on these medications. Antipsychotics have a wide range of side effects, including the risk of increased mortality (60-70% higher rate of death on antipsychotic compared to placebo) that led to an FDA black box warning for patients with dementia; a more recent review and meta-analysis showed a 54% increased risk of mortality. In addition, some patients show only partial response to antipsychotics and symptoms persist. For these reasons, the investigators need to study alternative treatment strategies. Currently, there is no FDA-approved medication for the treatment of psychosis or agitation in AD.~The investigators innovative project will examine the efficacy and side effects of low dose lithium treatment of agitation/aggression with or without psychosis in 80 patients with AD in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial (essentially a Phase II trial).

"87","NCT04522635_Fluid Mobilization in Hospitalized Patients With Acute Kidney Injury_Hospitalized patients often suffer from an acute shutdown of kidney function secondary to infections, use of antibiotics, or use of intravenous contrast agents. This results in the accumulation of toxic substances and retention of fluid in the body. Dialysis techniques are often needed to manage these patients to remove the retained toxic substances and extra fluid and allow the kidney time to recover. The amount and duration of fluid accumulation have been associated with a higher risk of death and longer hospital stays. Correction of fluid overload with dialysis has been shown to be beneficial in improving the outcomes from these patients. Most patients are quite sick and often have low levels of a blood protein called albumin that makes them more prone to developing low blood pressure during dialysis and limits the ability of dialysis to remove solutes and fluid adequately. Often dialysis sessions are complicated by the development of low blood pressures and symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and headaches that further compromises dialysis efficacy. In this study, the hypothesis that addition of intravenous albumin during the dialysis session will improve the ability to remove fluid and reduce the incidence of low blood pressure during dialysis thereby improving patient tolerance and the efficacy of the procedure will be tested. Patients with acute kidney failure or end-stage Renal Disease who need dialysis for fluid removal will be allocated to receive albumin or saline as intravenous fluids during individual dialysis sessions and information on how much fluid can be removed and how many complications occur in each session will be recorded. Dialysis sessions with albumin will be compared with those with saline alone to determine the benefit of adding albumin to the treatment. Information obtained from this study will allow physicians to manage patients requiring dialysis for acute kidney failure more effectively and help improve outcomes._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~age > 18 years old~need for intermittent hemodialysis during hospitalization~hypoalbuminemia (albumin<3g/dl)~Exclusion Criteria:~allergy to the components of albumin"
"88","NCT00847912_CSP #562 - The VA Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial_The main purpose of this study is to see if 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) skin cream can prevent the growth of new skin cancers on the face and ears. The cost of trying to prevent skin cancer will be compared to the usual cost of treating skin cancer. Participants are being asked to be a part of this study because the participants have been treated for two or more skin cancers within the past five (5) years. At least one of these cancers occurred on the face or ears. Having had two or more skins cancers in the past 5 years makes it likely that participants will develop additional skin cancers in the future.~Exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun or artificial sources such as tanning beds is a major cause of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Using lotions, creams, or gels that contain sunscreens can help protect the skin from premature aging and damage that may lead to skin cancer.~The 5-FU skin cream used in this study is FDA-approved to treat some types of skin cancers and spots that might become skin cancer. However, 5-FU skin cream has never been studied to see if it can prevent skin cancer. This drug is not approved by the FDA for how it will be used in this study.~In this study, one half of the patients will use the 5-FU cream and the other half will use a skin cream that looks identical to the 5-FU cream but does not have 5-FU or any other active drug in it.~Approximately twelve VA medical centers will work together in this study.

Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body-irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells.

"142","NCT00007631_CSP #402 - VA Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention Trial_One-third of all malignancies in the United States (approximately one million cases diagnosed annually) are nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). NMSC causes considerable morbidity, economic burden, facial deformity and at least 1,000 deaths annually. Prevention of these malignancies with a topical agent free of serious side effects would confer substantial public health benefit. Three hundred fifty thousand veterans were expected to develop NMSC in 1994. NMSC is one of the most common conditions requiring dermatologic care in the VA system. Topical tretinoin has been used extensively to treat photoaged skin. Retinoids administered orally in high doses appear to be effective in chemoprevention of nonmelanoma skin cancer but have unacceptable toxicity. In this study, 1131 patients with a recent history of squamous cell and/or basal cell carcinoma were enrolled at six participating centers over a four-year period and were randomly assigned to either 0.1% tretinoin cream or placebo. They were followed for a minimum of two years to determine if topical tretinoin is effective in reducing the risk of new occurrences._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~High risk individuals (at least 2 NMSC?S in last 5 years).~Exclusion Criteria:~Exclusion criteria would include systemic retinoid treatment or systemic chemotherapy within the past six months; indices of very high mortality risk within 3 years (history of invasive noncutaneous malignancy within the past five years or metastatic cutaneous malignancy, or of other severe medical problems e.g. end-stage cardiac disease); known allergy or severe irritation reaction to tretinoin or the cream vehicle; special conditions predisposing to NMSC that may not be generally applicable (xeroderma pigmentosum, basal cell nevus syndrome, major organ transplant recipient, known arsenic exposure, PUVA photochemotherapy, mycosis fungoides, or prior or current radiation therapy involving the face, ears, or area of prior skin cancer), and likely inability to comply with the requirements of the trial as judged by the investigator.

"157","NCT03149809_Behavioral or Solifenacin Therapy for Urinary Symptoms in Parkinson Disease_The impact of urinary symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) extends beyond worsened well-being. Urinary symptoms common in PD, especially incontinence and nocturia, are major risk factors for falls likely due to the combination of urinary urgency and impaired mobility (and falls are a leading cause of mortality in PD), for spouse/caregiver stress due to decreased mutuality in the relationship, and for institutionalization, largely due to increased disability. Additionally, most medications currently recommended for urinary symptoms in PD are anticholinergic and have the potential to worsen the progressive cognitive and autonomic burdens of the disease. Veterans with PD are also more likely to rely solely on VA for their health care than Veterans without PD. Thus, optimizing the care of urinary symptoms for Veterans with PD becomes imperative, particularly for VA.

"164","NCT00040456_The Effect of Oral Magnesium Pidolate on Incidence of Painful Crises in Patients With Hemoglobin SC Disease_Subjects have a form of sickle cell disease, called hemoglobin SC disease. This results in abnormally shaped red blood cells that get 'stuck' in blood vessels and then results in episodes of severe pain (pain crises). Patients with the more common form of sickle cell disease, called hemoglobin SS disease, also suffer from pain crises. Treatment with the drug hydroxyurea is available to help prevent the pain crises in hemoglobin SS disease, but there is no good treatment to help prevent the pain crises in hemoglobin SC disease.~It has been shown that one of the reasons for the formation of the abnormally shaped red blood cells in patients with SC disease is the fact that these cells do not contain enough water; they are dehydrated. Drinking more water will not increase the amount of water in the cells. Certain salts and minerals can however have an effect on the amount of water in the red blood cells. One of the most important minerals influencing this is called magnesium. Magnesium is present in food and also in certain medications used to treat heartburn. Magnesium has been used successfully both in animals and people to increase the amount of water in the red blood cells and is very well tolerated by most people.~Investigators are using a new form of magnesium known as magnesium pidolate because this form of magnesium may help with the symptoms of disease without causing diarrhea (a common side effect of magnesium products).~Purpose The purpose of this study is to find out whether treatment with magnesium pidolate will increase the amount of water in the red blood cell and result in fewer painful crises in patients with hemoglobin SC disease while not causing diarrhea.~The study will last for about 64 weeks (about 16 months)._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion criteria:~This protocol is open to male and female patients of all races with a diagnosis of severe sickle hemoglobinopathy providing they also satisfy the following eligibility criteria:~Adult and pediatric patients with Hb SC disease who are able to swallow the Mg pidolate preparation and who have had at least one prior painful crisis.~Exclusion Criteria:~Patients transfused within 90 days of study entry,~Patients with elevated (>1.5 times upper limit of normal for age) BUN, creatinine, or liver function tests > 3 times the upper limit of normal for age,~Patients who take a magnesium-containing medication (Mylanta, Maalox, etc.) on a regular (i.e., more than 2 days per week) basis.~Patients with progressive neuromuscular disease or patients who are treated with a calcium channel blocker.~Pregnancy"

Sleep dysfunction impacts up to 90% of PD patients. PD patients experience a variety of sleep disorders including parasomnias, specifically REM behavior disorder (RBD) that can precede the onset of motor manifestations of PD. RBD has negative consequences on patients' and their bed partners' quality of life mainly due to its impact on the sleep quality and day time alertness. RBD also predisposes affected individuals and their bed partners to physical injuries.~There are no FDA approved treatments for RBD. Clonazepam is the most commonly used treatment but carries risks of daytime sedation, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms. More recently, melatonin has been demonstrated to be effective in several small studies. Ramelteon, a selective melatonin receptor agonist with favorable safety profile, could potentially be effective for the treatment of RBD.~This pilot protocol will investigate safety and efficacy of ramelteon for the treatment of RBD in subjects with parkinsonism. We plan to recruit 20 subjects with RBD diagnosed based on the clinical interview and confirmed by the polysomnographic (PSG) data. The study is designed as a prospective randomized placebo controlled 12-week study. Primary outcome measure will be change in frequency of RBD events based on the daily sleep diaries. Secondary outcome measure will be change in the amount of tonic muscle activity based on the results of the baseline and final PSG. A number of other secondary and exploratory outcome measures will be collected_All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Diagnosis of parkinsonism (idiopathic PD, multiple systems atrophy, Lewy body dementia)~RBD frequency of at least once per week based on the RBD screening clinical questionnaire~PSG evidence of RBD~Presence of bed partner/caregiver who sleeps in the same room as PD patient~Exclusion Criteria:~Known hypersensitivity to ramelteon or related compounds, including melatonin and melatonin-related compounds.~Use of hypnotics or other sedatives within a month prior to the study initiation~Presence of active psychosis~Use of neuroleptics, except for the atypical neuroleptics - specifically quetiapine (the dose should not exceed 50mg/day)~Use of antidepressants unless the patient has been on a stable dose for at least three months~Use of Venlafaxine (Effexor®)~Presence of cognitive impairment, defined as the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score <24~Presence of depression defined as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score >14~Significant sleep disordered breathing (defined as an apnea-hypopnea index>15 events/hr of sleep on screening PSG), significant periodic limb movement disorder (defined as a PLM index>10 events/hr of sleep with awakening on screening PSG)~Travel through two time zones within a month prior to the study initiation"

"177","NCT00009191_NA_Major depression afflicts approximately 25 percent of patients with AD. Depression in AD patients leads to mental suffering, behavioral disturbance (such as aggression), poor cognition, poor self-care, caregiver depression, caregiver burden, and early entry into the nursing home. Since major depression is treatable, this additional disability may be avoidable. The use of antidepressants to treat major depression in AD is supported by two studies, although a third does not show a benefit for antidepressants over placebo. Also, the safety of antidepressant treatment in depressed AD patients is poorly studied. A conclusive study showing that depression reduction in AD can be accomplished safely with antidepressant medications, and that depression reduction is associated with improvements in activities of daily living, non-mood behavioral disturbances, caregiver burden, and caregiver depression would have major clinical and cost implications for the care of the AD patient. This study is a 13-week, double blind, flexible dose, placebo controlled trial of sertraline in the treatment of outpatients with AD and co-morbid major depression. The hypothesis is that antidepressant treatment is superior to placebo in improving mood, in improving cognition, in reducing physical dependency, in reducing caregiver depression, and in reducing caregiver burden. It is also hypothesized that the degree of depression reduction is correlated with these improvements. It is further hypothesized that the safety profile of sertraline when compared to placebo is acceptable, especially with regard to risk of falls, sleep disturbance, and delirium. One hundred community residing outpatients with probable AD who also meet DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode will be recruited into the study. They will be randomized to sertraline or placebo and followed through weekly telephone contact by an experienced clinical trials team. Outcomes will be assessed every 3 weeks, for a total of four followup data points.

"186","NCT00625391_GTP and Tai Chi for Bone Health: a Pilot Study_Osteoporosis is a major health problem in postmenopausal women. Our long-term goal is to develop a new alternative treatment that include a dietary supplement (green tea extract) and a mind-body exercise (Tai Chi) for lessening bone loss in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. A combination of dietary supplement and moderate intensity exercise now becomes a new alternative treatment in reducing bone loss in postmenopausal women with low bone mass, due to the possible stronger effects of the combination than individual treatments. Objective: To test a CAM intervention including green tea polyphenol (GTP) and Tai Chi (TC) exercise for feasibility, and to quantitatively assess their individual and conjugate effects on postmenopausal women with osteopenia. Hypotheses: (1) 24 weeks of GTP supplement, TC exercise, and their combination will benefit bone remodeling as measured by bone biomarkers and muscle strength/physical function in postmenopausal women with osteopenia compared to those receiving placebo only, and (2) the changes in bone biomarkers associated with bone remodeling will be correlated with the changes in oxidative stress._Female_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Women at least 2 years after menopause (to ensure established postmenopausal status).~Sedentary at baseline.~Normal laboratory evaluation, thyroid function, hepatic function, renal function.~Osteopenia.~Exclusion Criteria:~History of scoliosis, severe osteoarthritis, etc., or other spinal disease that may result in anatomy unsuitable for accurate bone densitometry.~History of cancer with some exceptions.~History of metabolic bone disease.~Having used anabolic steroids, calcitonin, calcitriol, alfacalcidol, etc.~Fluoride treatment at a dose greater than 1 mg/day any time.~History of glucocorticoid treatment.~Any previous treatment with bisphosphonates.~Uncontrolled intercurrent illness such as symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke, hypertension, or terminal illness.~Physical conditions that preclude participation of exercise intervention.~Cognitive impairment.~Depression.~History of malabsorption syndrome and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus."

Breast cancer can be treated with chemotherapy which can affect the bone marrow, where blood cells are produced. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cells that fight infection and are produced in the bone marrow. If the neutrophil count becomes low due to chemotherapy, a potentially serious condition called neutropenia occurs. Neutropenia is serious because it can affect the body's ability to protect against many types of infections. Pegfilgrastim is an investigational drug being evaluated for its potential ability to increase the number of neutrophils.

"215","NCT03008590_Low Dose Naltrexone for Chronic Pain in Osteoarthritis and Inflammatory Arthritis_Over 100 million Americans report chronic pain. Veterans are disproportionately affected for multiple reasons, including injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. Treatment for chronic pain is a priority research area for the VA. One of the most common causes of chronic pain is osteoarthritis (OA). OA is attributable to wear and tear, but reasons for pain are complex. Inflammatory arthritis (IA) includes multiple severe diseases that affect 2-3% of persons and require treatment with immune-suppressive drugs to prevent joint destruction. Pain often persists despite effective treatment. Pain in arthritis results from multiple sources: inflammation, perception of pain in the joint, and interpretation of pain by the brain. Unfortunately, management of pain in arthritis remains a challenge. Low dose naltrexone is a widely used but unproven alternative approach to chronic pain. It is attractive for study because it is safe and is proposed to work on all three pathways that contribute to pain. A small but high-quality clinical trial is needed to determine whether to invest in definitive studies._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Patients must meet all of the following criteria in order to be eligible for enrollment:~Veteran or otherwise eligible for VA benefits, able to travel to VA Boston~One or more of the following chronic conditions:~osteoarthritis~rheumatoid arthritis~non-axial spondyloarthritis~Average daily pain interference with function (average of the 7 parts of question 9 on the Brief Pain Inventory) rated at least 4 on a scale of 0-10, and no higher than 9~No change in medication in the past 8 weeks made with the expectation of improving pain~No plan to start another medication or a non-pharmacologic treatment regimen likely to affect pain during the next 16 weeks~Age at least 18~Registered for medical care in the VA Boston Healthcare System~Capable of informed consent, and willingness to comply with study procedures, including receipt of weekly phone calls from the study coordinator~Exclusion Criteria:~Any of the following requires exclusion from participation:~Current use of opioids including tramadol~Pregnant, breast feeding, or unwilling to engage in contraceptive practices if sexually active and capable of conceiving~Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or poorly controlled depression or anxiety~Previous use of low-dose naltrexone~Back pain described by the patient as greater in severity than arthritic pain in a non-axial location~Significant kidney disease, defined as glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min~Liver cirrhosis.

"221","NCT03455218_Nitric Oxide Administration During Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery to Prevent Platelet activation-a Single Center Pilot Study_Open heart surgery requires the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit. As blood flows across the artificial surfaces of the CPB circuit, platelets are activated and consumed. This activation results in a profound inflammatory reaction and need for transfusion. This reaction is intensified in younger, smaller patients undergoing longer, more complex open heart surgery. Nitric oxide is naturally released by vascular endothelial surfaces and acts as a signaling molecule which prevents platelet activation. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of the nitric oxide to the sweep gas of the oxygenator during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery will replace this natural endothelial function and thus prevent platelet activation and consumption. The investigators plan to test this hypothesis with a pilot double blinded, randomized trial of 40 patients less than a year of age undergoing cardiac surgery requiring CPB._All_N/A_1 Year_Inclusion Criteria:~Infants less than one year of age~Undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass~Exclusion Criteria:~Prior surgery requiring CPB within the same hospitalization~Pre-operative need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical circulatory support~Known hypersensitivity to nitric oxide~Known hemostatic or thrombotic disorder that results in an altered transfusion/anticoagulation protocol"
"222","NCT00156520_Jeanne Grace; Head Research Subjects Review Board_It is known that patients with aortic stenosis, including those undergoing cardiac surgery for this problem, are prone to developing bleeding problems, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract. It is believed that the shear stress associated with blood flow through the abnormal aortic valve results in abnormal hemostasis. Abnormalities include increased proteolysis of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) and increased binding of the high molecular weight multimers of vWF to platelet membranes with subsequent inappropriate platelet aggregation. Thus, appropriate aggregation of circulating platelets is impaired. Cardiac surgery is associated with significant alterations in hemostasis. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery consume a significant percent of available blood products throughout the United States and are subjected to various and numerous risks associated with blood product transfusion. In addition, excessive postoperative bleeding is a common cause for the need to surgically re-explore the chest cavity in patients who have just undergone cardiac surgical procedures. Such additional surgery carries further cost and risk. Following surgical correction of aortic valve stenotic pathology, associated vWF abnormalities appear to reverse. However, this process can take several days. Although all cardiac surgical patients are at risk for postoperative bleeding, patients undergoing aortic valve surgery for aortic stenosis may be particularly at risk for this postoperative complication. In addition, patients with aortic valve stenosis who undergo noncardiac surgery may have a predisposition to bleeding because of similar underlying shear stress induced abnormal vWF and platelet function. The proposed study is a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 different antifibrinolytic drugs in ameliorating the hemostatic defect associated with aortic stenosis. Aprotonin, an antifibrinolytic agent which also has platelet preserving actions4, will be compared to the currently used anti-fibrinolytic, epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA)._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:Study subjects will be competent adult patients who are scheduled to undergo elective aortic valve surgery for severe aortic stenosis.~- Exclusion Criteria: Potential study subjects will be excluded if they are scheduled to undergo elective aortic valve surgery for severe aortic stenosis and any other surgery simultaneously or have been taking aspirin within 6 days of surgery.~-"

"238","NCT05487300_Effect of Levodopa on Cardiovascular Autonomic Function in Parkinson's Disease With and Without Orthostatic Hypotension: a Cross-over Study_Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine and is the treatment of choice to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the effect of levodopa on cardiovascular autonomic function in PD is poorly understood. Orthostatic hypotension has been documented as a potential side effect of levodopa. As a result, clinicians may be reluctant to prescribe levodopa in patients with PD with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (PD+OH), which leads to suboptimal management of motor symptoms. On the other hand, other studies failed to show any clear relationship between levodopa and orthostatic hypotension in patients with PD. Important limitations of prior studies include the lack of detailed investigation of baroreflex cardiovagal and sympathetic noradrenergic functions and the fact that the same patients were not tested on and off levodopa.~The investigators propose to investigate the effects of levodopa on cardiovascular autonomic function in patients with PD+OH and PD without neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (PD-OH) by performing standardized autonomic testing in the same patients on and off levodopa._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Subjects with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease~For the subgroup of participants with orthostatic hypotension (OH), OH will be defined by a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure > 20 mmHg and/or a drop in diastolic blood pressure > 10 mmHg within 3 minutes from supine to standing during tilt not attributable to medications.

"259","NCT04158713_Chemoprevention With Monthly IPTp With Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for Malaria in HIV-infected Pregnant Participants on Daily Cotrimoxazole in Kenya and Malawi: a Multi-centre Placebo-controlled Trial_2.3.3 Short technical protocol summary Background: Pregnant women represent a vulnerable population for malaria. HIV-infected women are particularly at risk. In HIV-infected pregnant women, WHO recommends daily cotrimoxazole (CTX), an antifolate drug, for malaria chemoprevention and prophylaxis against opportunistic infection. However, there is cross-resistance with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and high levels of antifolate resistance threatens the antimalarial effect of CTX. Recent trials with intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) with mefloquine in HIV-infected women on daily CTX, suggested that chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial markedly improves the protection against malaria compared to daily CTX alone. However, mefloquine was not well tolerated.~The long-acting combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is well tolerated and has shown great promise as IPTp in HIV-negative women in East-Africa. Chemoprevention with monthly DP has also been explored in HIV-infected pregnant women on daily CTX in Uganda. Unfortunately, the study was inconclusive because malaria transmission was too low and a clinically relevant drug interaction with efavirenz (EFV) was found reducing the exposure to DP. WHO now recommends dolutegravir (DTG) based combination antiretroviral therapy (ARTs) as the preferred firstline regimen including for pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. As a result, many countries in Africa are now transitioning to DTG-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cARTs). No such drug-drug interaction is expected between DTG and DP. We will, therefore, assess the safety and efficacy of malaria chemoprevention with monthly DP in HIV-infected women on daily CTX and DTG-based cARTs.~Objectives and methods: This is a 2-arm, individually-randomized, multi-centre, placebo-controlled superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of daily CTX plus monthly DP ('CTX-DP') versus daily CTX plus monthly placebo-DP (i.e. 'CTX-alone', control arm) to reduce malaria and the adverse effects of malaria in 898 (449 per arm) HIV-infected pregnant women on DTG-based cARTs. The study will be conducted in 8 hospitals in Kenya and Malawi in high SP-resistance areas with a high prevalence of malaria. These are the same sites where the sister trial in HIV-uninfected women is being conducted in Kenya and Malawi (IMPROVE trial). Both the mother and baby will be followed for 6-8 weeks after delivery. The study is powered at 80% (alpha=0.05) to detect ≥50% relative risk reduction (RR=0.50) in the primary outcome (cumulative incidence of malaria infection) from 12% in the CTX-alone arm (control arm) to 6% in in the interventions arm allowing for 20% non-contributors. The trial includes a pharmacokinetic assessment, cardiac monitoring for safety, assessment of antimalarial drug and the impact on immune responses to malaria and other pathogens._Female_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~HIV-infected pregnant women between 16-28 weeks' gestation~Viable singleton pregnancy~On or eligible for cARTs and CTX~A resident of the study area~Willing to adhere to scheduled and unscheduled study visit procedures~Willing to deliver in a study clinic or hospital~Provide written informed consent~Exclusion Criteria:~Multiple pregnancies (i.e. twin/triplets)~HIV-negative or HIV status unknown~Known heart ailment~Severe malformations or non-viable pregnancy if observed by ultrasound~Participants with advanced HIV-disease at WHO clinical stage 3 and 4~Confirmed or suspected TB infection,~Unable to give consent~Known allergy or contraindication to any of the study drugs"

While treatment of iron-deficiency anemia with iron supplementation is recommended, treatment strategies remain controversial: the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends oral iron supplementation with parental iron reserved for the rare patient who cannot tolerate or will not take oral iron, while UK professional organizations recommend a more liberal use of parenteral iron. The reason for these disparate recommendations is that few high-quality studies comparing oral to parenteral iron have been conducted in developed countries, and the potential impact of parental iron treatment on obstetric and perinatal outcomes remains unclear. We propose the first randomized-controlled trial in the United States describing the effectiveness and safety of treating pregnant women with iron-deficiency anemia with a protocol including parenteral iron compared with a protocol based on oral iron._Female_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Iron-deficiency anemia (serum ferritin <30 micrograms, normal hemoglobin electrophoresis, and hemoglobin <10 mg/dL), planned delivery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital~Exclusion Criteria:~Non-iron-deficiency anemia, multiple gestation, prenatally diagnosed major fetal anomalies, known aneuploidy, planned delivery at other hospital, inability to obtain consent"

"287","NCT00590018_Corticosteroids in Postoperative Critically Ill Neonates With Low Cardiac Output Syndrome With Congenital Heart Disease_Babies having heart surgery often have problems after surgery with their blood pressure and getting enough blood to their bodies. To treat this they require medicines to keep their blood pressure high enough to get blood to their bodies. The side effects of these medicines include fast heart rates and increasing the amount of work the heart has to do. Corticosteroids are made by the body and help to use the energy in the food people eat, control the chemicals in their blood and maintain their blood pressure. Corticosteroids made by the body may be decreased in patients that have major surgery. Corticosteroids help to increase blood pressure and can decrease the amount of blood pressure medicines a patient requires. Corticosteroids have been shown to increase blood pressure in patients with bacterial infections and in very small, premature babies but have only been studied in a few babies who have had heart surgery. The way corticosteroids work is unknown but may involve decreasing the body's response to being on a heart-lung machine or give steroids not being made by the patient.~Corticosteroids have been shown to be helpful in treating many diseases. The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of corticosteroids in babies who have had heart surgery and need blood pressure medicines in the intensive care unit after surgery. Our idea is that getting corticosteroids will allow us to decrease the amount of blood pressure medicines each patient needs and improve how they do after surgery. We also plan to do blood tests to help determine how the corticosteroids are working.~It will be randomly determined if the subject receives corticosteroids or salt water. The subject will receive a corticosteroid or salt water once a day for five days. Their vital signs will be monitored, especially blood pressure and their need for medicines to increase their blood pressure.

"296","NCT01472549_Antiseptic Skin Preparation for Preventing Surgical Site Infection at Cesarean Delivery: a Randomized Comparative Effectiveness Trial_The investigators propose a randomized controlled clinical trial to determine the comparative effectiveness of chlorhexidine-alcohol and iodine-alcohol preoperative skin preparation for preventing surgical site infections at cesarean section. While estimates vary, surgical site infections complicate up to 5 - 10% of all cesarean sections and result in significant human suffering and excess health care costs. Interventions such as preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis reduce surgical site infections by 60%, but the rate of infection remains high. There is therefore a great need to identify and test other potential interventions to further reduce these infections.~The skin is a major source of pathogens that cause surgical site infection. Therefore, optimizing preoperative skin antisepsis has the potential to decrease postoperative surgical site infections. There is paucity of evidence to guide the choice of antiseptic for skin preparation at cesarean section. To date, only two underpowered trials have been published comparing two methods of preoperative skin preparation at cesarean section. A recent randomized trial in adults undergoing clean-contaminated mostly general surgical procedures demonstrated a 41% reduction in surgical site infection with the use of chlorhexidine-alcohol when compared to the more commonly used povidone-iodine. While it is plausible that findings from trials in other clean-contaminated surgical procedures may apply to cesarean sections, physiological changes in pregnancy, the peculiar dual microbial source for cesarean-related infections and the hormone-mediated immune-modulation in pregnancy make the validity of such extrapolation uncertain.~The study has the following specific aims:~Primary Aim: To test the hypothesis that preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation at cesarean section significantly reduces surgical site infections compared to iodine-alcohol.~Secondary Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation at cesarean section significantly reduces bacterial contamination at the surgical site compared to iodine-alcohol.~Secondary Aim 2: To determine clinical outcomes and medical costs associated with cesarean-related infections and quantify potential cost savings attributable to use of chlorhexidine-alcohol for preoperative skin preparation at cesarean section._Female_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Women undergoing cesarean delivery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.~Exclusion Criteria:~Inability to obtain consent; allergy to chlorhexidine, alcohol, iodine, shellfish; and evidence of infection adjacent to operative site."

Propofol produces sedation, hypnosis, and dense amnesia, and is commonly used in the ED at Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) for procedural sedation. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that is also frequently used in the ED in children and sometimes in adults. It has been proposed that by combining the two agents, the negative side effects of respiratory depression and hypotension associated with propofol, and the negative effects of dysphoria and vomiting associated with ketamine, can be avoided.~In the proposed study, patients seen in the ED who will require procedural sedation for a painful procedure will be randomized to receive either propofol or propofol and ketamine. During the procedure, patients will be monitored per the standard of care, including use of a cardiac monitor, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, pulse oximetry, nasal sample end-tidal carbon dioxide, and physician assessment.

"325","NCT05610085_A Phase IIb Dose Escalation Study of Levetiracetam for the Treatment of Neonatal Seizures_The main purpose of this study is to determine the maximum safe tolerated dose of LEV in the treatment of neonatal seizures. Our hypothesis is that optimal dosing of Levetiracetam (LEV) to treat neonatal seizures is significantly greater than 60mg/kg. This study will be an open label dose-escalation, preliminary safety and efficacy study. There will be a randomized control treatment component. Infants recognized as having neonatal seizures or as being at risk of developing seizures will be recruited and started on continuous video EEG monitoring (CEEG). Eligibility will be confirmed and consent will be obtained. In the first 2 phases of the study, neurologists will identify neonates with mild-moderate seizure burden (less than 8 minutes cumulative seizure activity per hour), appropriate for study with LEV, and exclude patients with higher seizure burden where treatment with PHB is more appropriate. Phase 3 of the dose escalation will only proceed if additional efficacy of LEV has been demonstrated in phases 1 and 2. In Phase 3 we will recruit neonates with seizures of greater severity up to 30 minute seizure burden/hour. This will make the final results of study more generalizable.~If seizures are confirmed, enrolled subjects will receive 60mg/kg of LEV. Subjects whose seizures persist or recur 15 minutes after the first infusion is complete, subjects will then be randomized in the dose escalation study.

"327","NCT02631174_Evaluation Of The Pharmacokinetics Of Antithrombin III In Neonates And Infants Undergoing CPB And ECMO Support_The potential role of ATIII in achieving and maintaining adequate anticoagulation in pediatric patients on the heart-lung machine has recently taken on increased importance as caregivers strive to mitigate the risk for clinically significant clotting problems. It is known that ATIII levels are decreased in normal neonates and infants less than 6 months of age relative to older children and adults and become even further decreased in critically ill neonates and infants, including those with congenital heart disease. The current utilization of ATIII in the context of support on a heart-lung machine is based on pharmacokinetic data derived from adult subjects with congenital ATIII deficiency. There is a gap in knowledge as to the appropriate frequency of ATIII repletion, best method of monitoring, and mode of administration in critically ill neonates and infants receiving support on a heart-lung machine.Our long-term goal is to determine if antithrombin (ATIII) can effectively change the coagulation system in patients undergoing heart-lung machine support. The objective of this proposal, which is our first step in pursuit of that goal, is to determine the pharmacokinetics of ATIII in neonates and infants. Our central hypothesis is that ATIII will have different pharmacokinetic properties in neonates and infants than adults and these properties will be affected by the use of heart-lung machine.~This research will result in critical data on the pharmacokinetics of ATIII in neonates and infants receiving heart-lung machine support. This contribution is significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lead to the development of a therapeutic strategy employing ATIII that will facilitate improved modulation of the coagulation cascade to prevent significant clotting and bleeding complications in pediatric patients requiring heart-lung machine support._All_N/A_1 Year_Inclusion Criteria:~1.

Even a minor infection can extend the hospitalization after cardiac surgery. The average minimum increase in length of stay for a single infection is three days.~One of the many means used to reduce post-operative infections is the preventative, or prophylactic, administration of antibiotics just before and just after surgery. Because antibiotics, and for that matter surgery itself, alter the body's natural immune and inflammatory responses and the makeup of the bacteria in the intestine, there is a great deal of scientific interest in using the supplementation of bacteria that naturally reside in the intestine.

"355","NCT03355326_Evaluation of Routine Administration of Glycerin Suppositories to Improve Bowel Function in Patients With Uncomplicated Gastroschisis_Gastroschisis is a congenital defect of the abdominal wall that leads to evisceration of various amounts of the abdominal organs. The mainstay of therapy is restoring continuity of the abdominal wall, either through primary closure or with a synthetic graft when primary closure is not feasible.~It has been established that bowel function after repair of gastroschisis is impaired due to the aforementioned pathological processes. Previous studies have shown that the time from surgery to attaining full nutrition through enteral means is a predictor for morbidity in this population. Therefore, numerous therapeutic interventions have been proposed to help hasten bowel function and decrease the time to tolerance of total enteral nutrition. A common, but unproven, technique is the use of glycerin suppositories to stimulate bowel function. The concept of glycerin suppositories is that stimulating colonic activity through the use of the suppository will stimulate small intestinal function. The underlying concept is that improved bowel motility and reduced time to full enteral feeds will reduce the morbidity associated with this disease. While the formation/evacuation of stools is most easily monitored, the main purpose of using these suppositories is to hasten tolerance of nutrition through enteral means.~While the practice of using glycerin suppositories is common in neonates, there is no literature or best-practice guidelines advocating for (or against) their use. A single previous prospective study utilizing glycerin suppositories in premature, low birth weight neonates failed to show any benefit in improving time to tolerate full enteral feeds. At this time, this is the only study investigating the use of glycerin suppositories in any neonatal population, and due to the indications (i.e. premature and low birth weight infants without surgical disease), the findings are not applicable to neonates with gastroschisis. To the authors' knowledge, there are no previous studies or current ongoing studies examining this question. Given this lack of information regarding the efficacy of glycerin suppositories, there is a significant variation in practice among practicing surgeons, including timing of initial administration, frequency of use, and indication to discontinue. Indeed the spectrum ranges from some surgeons who never use glycerin suppositories, to some who prescribe them daily for all gastroschisis patients immediately following surgery.~The purpose of this study will be to determine whether routine use of glycerin suppositories improves bowel function as measured by time to full enteral feeds (primary outcome: defined as enteral feed volume >120mL/kg/day with appropriate weight gain (20-30g/day for two consecutive days)) in neonates with uncomplicated gastroschisis after complete reduction of abdominal viscera.

"385","NCT02766673_Safety and Efficacy of Aerosolized Albuterol in Mechanically Ventilated Infants With Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BDP)_Currently several dose schedules of Albuterol are administered via nebulization to infants in the neonatal and infant intensive care unit (N/IICU). As Albuterol is not FDA approved for this population (under 2 years) there is no standard recommended dose. Aerosolized Albuterol is one of the most widely used therapies that are utilized for infants with chronic lung disease. The common practice in the N/IICU is weight base dosing of all medications. This contradicts the aerosol science recommendations, which advise not to titrate doses by weight as the patient naturally self-regulates their dose according to the change in minute ventilation with age. In addition, the wide use of aerosolized Albuterol in the infant with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) has little current evidence of efficacy in this disease. Understanding the appropriate dose for effective treatment as well as the indication for use in the BPD population would provide the clinician with useful guidelines.~The investigators propose to analyze the safety and efficacy of aerosolized albuterol in infants with BPD comparing the recommended dose per aerosolization literature with the common dosing practices at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) as well as placebo._All_N/A_1 Year_Inclusion Criteria:~Infants greater than or equal to 36 weeks corrected gestational age to one year of age~Diagnosis of BPD in accordance with The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) definition~May have a current order for short acting bronchodilator, not required~May have congenital anomalies unless one or more of the exclusion criteria are met, not required~Receiving conventional mechanical ventilation via an artificial airway (endotracheal tube or tracheostomy) via Draeger V500 Ventilator~Parental/guardian permission (informed consent)~Exclusion Criteria:~Airway leak greater than 10%~Unilateral lung disease~Current order for inhaled anticholinergic (i.e. ipratropium bromide)~Active pulmonary or systemic infection~Scheduled order for other medication that cause bronchodilation (i.e. atrovent, magnesium sulfate, ketamine, etc.)"

"389","NCT00251823_The Safety and Efficacy of Eptifibatide-Facilitated Percutaneous Coronary Angioplasty Versus Primary Percutaneous Coronary Angioplasty Alone_Rationale:~ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is usually triggered by rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque that then accumulates platelets and fibrin and leads to an occlusive coronary thrombus. Clinical benefits obtained with revascularization of the infarct related artery (IRA) depend on the achievement of four goals:~Early reperfusion~Full restoration of normal flow in the epicardial vessels~Full restoration of flow in the microcirculation, and~Preservation of myocardial function.~Reperfusion of the IRA can be achieved pharmacologically with intravenous thrombolytic agents, or mechanically with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In Canada, thrombolysis is the current standard of care in most hospitals, although there is mounting evidence that primary PCI is superior, and many Canadian centres are shifting towards this strategy. To offer primary PCI to community hospitals without on site cardiac catheterization facilities, regional programs need to be present that allow rapid transfer to invasive centers that offer this procedure round-the-clock.~Recent evidence suggests that angiographic and clinical results with primary PCI could be further enhanced by facilitation with a pharmacological treatment given prior to the procedure. The present proposal plans to examine the safety and efficacy of eptifibatide to facilitate coronary angioplasty in STEMI in patients who present to centres with and without on-site catheterization facilities.~The primary outcome measure will be a composite clinical endpoint including death, recurrent myocardial infarction, recurrent unstable ischemia, or stroke, at 30 days.~Secondary endpoints include the percent thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 3 coronary flow after the PCI, myocardial perfusion score, individual clinical outcomes as listed for the primary endpoint, resolution of ST-segment elevation, requirement for subsequent revascularization, frequency of congestive heart failure (CHF), cardiogenic shock, and Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina class._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Ischemic chest discomfort of 30 minutes duration~Onset of chest pain 12 hours prior to entry into the study~ST segment elevation of > 1 mm (0.1 mV) in two or more contiguous electrocardiographic leads (on a standard 12 lead electrocardiogram [ECG]), or left bundle branch block not known to be old~Exclusion Criteria:~Active bleeding~History of stroke within 90 days or any intracranial bleed.~Major surgery or trauma within the past 6 weeks~Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 200 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 110 mm Hg despite treatment)~Prolonged (> 10 minutes) cardiopulmonary resuscitation~Inadequate vascular access~PCI within the last 30 days~Thrombolytic agents within the preceding 7 days~Concurrent use of warfarin~A blood coagulation disorder (i.e. international normalized ratio [INR] > 2.0, platelet count < 100,000/mm3, or hematocrit < 30%)~Intolerance to aspirin or clopidogrel~A subcutaneous therapeutic dose of any low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) within 12 hours~Known severe contrast allergy~Other medical condition that is likely to result in death within 12 months~Participation in a study or another investigational device or drug trial within the past four weeks~Pregnancy~Known severe renal impairment (creatinine > 200 mole/l)~Sustained hypotension, systolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg, or the need for intravenous (IV) inotropes and/or intraaortic balloon counterpulsation to support the blood pressure~Inability to provide informed consent"
"390","NCT05201144_A Trial of Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitor in Neonatal Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (TOP-CDH)_Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs in approximately 1 in 3000 US live births, similar to the incidence seen within the Utah Birth Defects cohort. The diaphragmatic defect compromises lung growth and alters pulmonary vascular development. This is reflected postnatally as respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and overall cardiopulmonary dysfunction, particularly post-repair. Currently, optimal management of post-repair PH remains poorly investigated. Sildenafil citrate is a highly selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that increases cGMP levels, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and an anti-proliferative effect within the pulmonary vasculature. It is used off-label for many neonatal PH disorders, including PH associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and idiopathic persistent PH. Most neonates with CDH born within the Mountain West referral basin are managed at a quaternary care center, Primary Children's Hospital (PCH). Of these neonates with PH, approximately 25% have been treated with off-label sildenafil. However, neither the PCH clinical care group nor others have developed/published a standardized approach for either initiating or discontinuing sildenafil therapy in this group of patients. Thus, the aim of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of sildenafil therapy for PH in neonates with CDH within the Utah cohort. Given the relatively short-term outcome and small sample size for this trial, the plan is to use this data to support a larger multicenter randomized trial targeting long-term cardiopulmonary outcomes of infants with CDH and post-repair PH._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Infants admitted to PCH NICU~Diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)~Status post-surgical repair of diaphragmatic defect~Has an echocardiogram 48-72 hours after repair with left ventricular eccentricity index (LVEI) ≥ 1.4~Parental consent obtained within 24 hours after the above echocardiogram~Exclusion Criteria:~Infants with CDH who do not undergo surgical repair~Does not have an echocardiogram 48-72 hours post-repair~Has LVEI < 1.4 on above echocardiogram~Has concurrent severe congenital heart defect that requires neonatal cardiac repair~Has a documented sildenafil allergy~Concurrent therapy with fluconazole at time of study drug initiation~Inability to obtain parental consent within 24 hours of the echocardiogram~Receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the time of the study"

"429","NCT03511976_Adaptive Response to Intervention (RTI) for Students With ADHD_Purpose: The primary purpose of the proposed project is to investigate the efficacy of Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions delivered through a Response to Intervention (RTI) framework for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Further, for children who do not respond to initial Tier 2 strategies, the proposed study will assess which additional course of intervention is most effective: (1) enhanced Tier 2 strategies or (2) stimulant medication. The majority of youth with ADHD are in general education settings, whether classified as special education students or not. Thus, experimentally evaluating the efficacy of well-developed and evidence-based behavioral interventions within a problem-solving framework such as RTI would significantly inform practice within school-based behavioral intervention teams.~Project Activities: This study will employ a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial design (SMART). Prior to the beginning of the academic year, students will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) Business as Usual in which children receive whatever sequence of academic supports and interventions their teachers, school, and parents would typically put into place throughout the entire academic year and (2) an RTI approach to begin with Tier 1 classroom-wide management strategies with opportunities to add Tier 2 strategies for youth who do not respond to the initial Tier 1 approach._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Child meets DSM-V diagnostic criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder~Child will be entering grades 1 - 5~Exclusion Criteria:~Child or sibling living in the same home has history of sustained successful treatment of ADHD with stimulant medication~Child currently has a special education placement involving placement in reduced ratio classroom or having a part or full-time aid due to behavior problems~Child has an IQ less than 70~Child has psychosis or a pervasive developmental disorder~Child is in a classroom that already has a study participant~Child is home-schooled"

"431","NCT00523107_PG2 Treatment for Improving Fatigue Among Advanced Cancer Patients Under Standard Palliative Care_The objective of this study is to conduct a trial in the spirit of providing as much as possible the benefit of PG2 treatment to eligible patients and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PG2 for relieving fatigue among advanced cancer patients who are under standard palliative care (SPC) at hospice setting and have no further curative options available. Patient's fatigue status, to be measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwanese Form (BFI-T), will be the primary endpoint. The fatigue improvement response rate among patients between two study arms will then be compared as the basis for efficacy evaluation at the end of the first treatment cycle, and will be the primary endpoint. Other endpoints, the fatigue improvement response rate and the mean fatigue scores change from baseline among patients within and between cycles will be included in the secondary efficacy endpoints, and will be compared between two study arms. Patients' quality of sleep, appetite, pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and global quality of life (QoL) will be also measured by 11 questions (SS11) from EORTC QLQ-C30 for secondary endpoint evaluation. The other secondary endpoints include Karnofsky performance scores, and weight change and its related c-reactive protein level of the patients.~* BFI-T (Brief Fatigue Inventory - Taiwan) : The BFI is a 9-item self-administered questionnaire which was developed by MD Anderson Cancer Center offers assessing levels of fatigue. Subjects rate each item based on how they felt for the preceding week using a 1-10 numeric rating scale (10 being the most unfavorable response). The single construct of the BFI allows for the mean of the nine items to be the overall score. The score is categorized as mild (1-3), moderate (4-6), and severe (7-10). The scale is a reliable instrument that correlates highly with similar fatigue and performance status measures._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Signed the informed consent form~≧ 18 years old~Have locally advanced or metastatic cancer or inoperable advanced cancer~Under standard palliative care (SPC) at hospice setting and have no further curative options available~BFI fatigue score ≧ 4~Women with childbearing potential must use contraception~Life expectancy of at least 3 months as determined by the investigator~Willing and able to complete quality of life questionnaires~Exclusion Criteria:~Pregnant or breast-feeding females~Uncontrolled systemic disease such as active infection, severe heart disease, uncontrollable hypertension or diabetes mellitus~Take central nervous system stimulators such as Methylphenidate within last 30 days~In other investigational drug trials within last 30 days~Karnofsky performance scores < 30%~Diagnosed as dying status"

"434","NCT00403273_Botulinum Toxin A for Painful Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA): Randomized, Controlled, Triple-blind Study_Primary Total Knee joint replacement surgery is highly successful surgery for relieving pain and improving function in patients with disabling arthritis. Unfortunately, like all biomedical devices, prosthesis failure is a complication of knee replacement surgery that leads to disabling pain, stiffness and loss of function. Approximately 1% of the knee replacements fail every year leading to a 20% failure rate over 20 years. The common causes of failure of prosthetic joint are infection, loosening, trauma or wear of the prosthesis. Currently, a revision surgery is the best option for long term pain relief (analgesics or other pain medications are options but are of limited benefit). Surgery may not be feasible in patients due to advancing age, other medical conditions and surgical/technical difficulties or patient's choice. In addition, the results from revision surgery are not as good as the initial knee joint surgery. Therefore, there is a great need for a novel, targeted therapy that provides an option to patients who are unfit, unable, or unwilling to undergo surgery.~In the investigators' recent pilot study, a single injection of Botulinum toxin A (Botox) in painful natural knee, ankle and shoulder joints of patients with various types of arthritis led to significant and durable improvement in pain and function and was safe to use. The investigators propose this 6-month study to compare pain relief, improvement of function and safety of an injection of Botulinum toxin compared to placebo in patients with a painful prosthetic knee joint. Both patients and investigators will be blinded to the treatment assignment to a patient until the study is completed. The investigators will assess the amount and duration of pain relief, improvement in function and short term safety of Botulinum toxin using standard validated measures. Patients will be evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 6-months after a single injection of either placebo or BoNT/A in the hip or knee prosthesis. The six-month follow-up is to assess the duration of meaningful pain relief. If successful, this will offer a new treatment option for patients with a chronically painful knee prosthetic joint, provide more insight into the origin and cause of pain in prosthetic joints and direct future investigations in new directions._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Male or female subjects, 18 years of age or older.~Written informed consent and written authorization for use or release of health and research study information have been obtained.~Subject has chronic Prosthetic knee joint pain for more than 3 months.~Subject has pain 6 or greater on a 10 point Numerical Pain Rating scale~Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits.~Negative urine pregnancy test on the day of treatment prior to the administration of study medication (for females of childbearing potential).

"449","NCT02206984_A Trial of Endocrine Response in Women With Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer_RATIONALE: Currently, adjuvant endocrine therapy often follows a one-size-fits- all approach, with most premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, and most postmenopausal receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy. In current clinical practice, patients with invasive lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer subtype.~PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.~Primary Objective:~To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily)._Female_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Histologically confirmed invasive lobular breast cancer, that is hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative, measuring at least 1 centimeter (cm) radiographically or clinically, clinical stages I-III. Invasive lobular histology will be diagnosed at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation. Subsequently, invasive lobular histology will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to patient enrollment.~Prior to initiation of study agents, study participants will be highly encouraged to undergo a baseline research core biopsy of their breast tumor. If this is not possible or the patient refuses, the pre-treatment tumor sample must be obtained from their archival diagnostic core biopsy. If definitive surgery is not performed at day 21-27 after study treatment, a second post-treatment research core biopsy will need to be obtained from their breast tumor. For patients undergoing surgery, the second biopsy will be removed from the breast tumor tissue excised during their operation. Note: In the event that the baseline breast tumor biopsy performed for research purposes does not yield adequate tumor tissue for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints, tissue will be requested from the patient's archival clinical diagnostic core biopsy if it is available.The patient will still remain on study and complete protocol therapy as planned in this unlikely event.~Hormone receptor (HR) status of the invasive component must be documented before trial enrollment. The tumor must be HR-positive. HR will be considered positive if staining is 1% or greater for ER and/or PR. This will be determined at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation and enrollment onto the trial. Subsequently, HR status will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to enrolling the patient. HER2 status will be determined locally only, based upon current ASCO/CAP guidelines.~Patients must be female.~Participants must be fully postmenopausal.~ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.~Adequate organ and marrow function as defined by a history and physical exam that rules out comorbidities that would be exclusions to participation in the study (see exclusion criteria) and clinical laboratory parameters as deemed clinically appropriate by the treating physician.~Prior use of hormone contraceptives and replacement therapy is allowed (e.g., estrogen and/or progestin), but must have been discontinued at least 30 days prior to the study enrollment. Vaginal preparations (e.g., Vagifem® or Estring®)~Participant must be aware of the nature of her malignancy, understand the study requirements and risks and be able and willing to sign a written informed consent document.~Exclusion Criteria:~Prior or concurrent use of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or novel therapy to treat the current breast cancer, including any history of prior irradiation to the ipsilateral breast. Additionally, the patient must not have had hormonal therapy for breast cancer treatment or for breast cancer prevention within 2 years prior to study enrollment. (Note: Synchronous breast, cancer (including bilateral breast cancer) at separate sites is permissible, provided the patient does not receive medical treatments for breast cancer or radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast during the 21 day study intervention period.~Concurrent use of any other investigational agents.~History of allergic reactions/hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to tamoxifen, anastrozole, or fulvestrant or any of their ingredients.~History of thromboembolic disease or uterine cancer that is considered a contraindication to tamoxifen.~Active hepatitis viral infections or a known history of liver disease, especially moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) to severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.~Uncontrolled current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.~HER-2 positivity.~Increased Risk of bleeding: including a history of a bleeding diathesis and/or known history of severe thrombocytopenia. NOTE: Anticoagulant use is not a contraindication to fulvestrant, but caution is advised in administration in patients on anticoagulation. Patients on anticoagulation who will receive fulvestrant will have PT and aPTT/INR assessed at baseline."

"473","NCT03656198_Non-specific Effects of Rabies Vaccine on the Incidence of Common Infectious Disease Episodes: a Randomized Controlled Trial_Vaccines work by stimulating the body to produce a high-quality, rapid and specific immune response upon exposure to infection by a particular disease-causing microorganism - the microorganism targeted by the vaccine. Evidence is emerging that some vaccines may have additional 'non-specific effects' (NSEs); that is, effects on the immune system beyond the direct protection against the diseases for which the vaccines were developed. It has been proposed that rabies vaccine has protective NSEs in people and animals, with receipt of rabies vaccine in children associated with a reduced risk of meningitis and cerebral malaria in one study, and a history of rabies vaccination in free-roaming dogs associated with increased survival rates in another study. Studies in mice have shown that prior rabies vaccination protects against bacterial sepsis. The biological mechanism of action of any such NSE of rabies vaccine is unknown. Other vaccines with reported protective NSEs (e.g. bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine against tuberculosis, a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis) have been show to reprogram the immune system, leading to enhanced protection against infection with disease-causing microorganisms unrelated to M. tuberculosis.~In this study, we will test the hypothesis that rabies vaccine has non-specific protective effects against common infectious disease (CID) syndromes (upper respiratory illness, diarrhea and fever) in a population of veterinary students. We will randomly assign previously-unvaccinated students who volunteer for the study to receive a primary course of three injections of rabies vaccine (experimental group) or an identical course of three injections of sterile water (control group). Participants will not know to which group they have been assigned. We will ask all participants to report episodes of illness through an online survey each week for 26 weeks, and will also record all clinically- and laboratory-confirmed cases of illness with CID syndromes. We hypothesize that rates of self-reported new episodes of CID illness over 26 weeks will be at least 25% lower in the experimental group, relative to the control group._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~A student registered at RUSVM, and in the Veterinary Preparatory (VP) program or the 1st or 5th semester of the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) program~Exclusion Criteria:~A student registered at RUSVM and in the VP program or the 1st or 5th semester of the DVM program will be excluded from the study if s/he:~has previously received a dose of rabies vaccine, or~is intending to undertake activities during the course of participation in the study that would increase their risk category of rabies exposure above that of the U.S. population at large, as defined by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for human rabies prevention, or~does not provide informed consent for participation, or~enrolls in the study but does not present for the first injection within the first 12 weeks of the semester (up to and including Week 12), or~has a contraindication to rabies vaccine as described in the Rabivax-S package insert"

"475","NCT00671060_Misoprostol for Treatment of Fetal Death at 14-28 Weeks of Pregnancy, Inclusive, Not Accompanied by Complete Expulsion of the Contents of the Uterus_The purpose of the proposed study is to test - in a randomized, blinded trial - two different doses of the prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol administered buccally as a treatment for fetal death at 14 - 28 weeks, inclusive, of pregnancy. At such an advanced stage of pregnancy, the nonviable fetus is often not spontaneously evacuated, and yet timely evacuation is vital in order to avoid the possibility of, among other things, potentially life-threatening maternal coagulopathies. Current approaches to uterine evacuation in these cases include dilatation and evacuation (D&E) surgery (in less advanced pregnancies) and labor induction with a variety of products. Misoprostol has been demonstrated to be as effective as, or more effective than, either oxytocin or prostaglandin E2 analogues for this indication in a number of small, non-FDA-approved trials which have been published in the peer-reviewed literature. In the absence of more formal study of this treatment, however, dosages are not standardized, pathways of administration vary, and other uncertainties linger. The purpose of the protocol proposed herein is to formally establish, via a randomized, double-blinded study, the safety and effectiveness of misoprostol for this indication, and to compare the value of two distinct doses, so that providers may henceforward proceed with greater authority and confidence._Female_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Women presents with spontaneous fetal death~Gestational age of fetus between 14-28 weeks~Exclusion Criteria:~Transmural uterine scar;~Allergies or other contraindications to use of misoprostol;~Placental abruption with active hemorrhage;~Complete placenta previa;~Extreme uterine structural anomalies;~Or other contraindications to vaginal delivery of the fetus;~Presentation in active labor (moderate to severe contractions every 10 minutes); or~Four or more previous deliveries"

The current standard practice for people with clotting abnormalities is to transfuse additional blood before the surgery, in an effort to decrease bleeding problems. However, transfusing blood before the surgery is not very effective in decreasing bleeding complications. In addition, it may be associated with other complications, including fluid buildup and swelling in the lungs. For this study, a person with a mild clotting problem is defined as one with an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.5 and 3. Severe clotting is defined as an INR greater than 3. This study will aim to test if limiting or restricting transfusion for those patients with severe clotting problems (an INR greater than 3) will result in fewer transfusion problems and fewer unnecessary transfusions in comparison with the current, more liberal, transfusion use for all patients with both mild and severe clotting problems (an INR greater than 1.5).The investigators will also determine if liberal blood transfusion decreases the risk of bleeding after surgical procedures._All_1 Year_N/A_Inclusion:~Consenting hospitalized adult~(>18 years)~Patients with abnormal INR (INR 1.6-3) due to either vitamin K depletion or antagonism (Coumadin and/or broad spectrum antibiotics) or liver insufficiency~Patients who are about to undergo one of the three common minimally invasive procedures (thoracocentesis, abdominal paracentesis, and central vein cannulation)~Exclusion:~None"

In this procedure, systemic venous return is rerouted directly to the pulmonary arteries, which serves to separate the systemic and pulmonary circulations. Although mortality following the Fontan operation is now uncommon, early postoperative morbidity including prolonged postoperative chest tube drainage and hospitalization remains significant. The efficacy of empiric inotropic, vasodilator and neurohumoral-inhibitory therapies in the perioperative period is unknown and practice varies widely between centers.~The investigators will propose a single-center, randomized, double-blind, phase II clinical trial in children undergoing Fontan surgery. The investigators plan to compare the effects of perioperative nesiritide, milrinone and placebo infusions on the early postoperative clinical course and neurohumoral profile.

An open, phase III study involving 17 centers in France.~The study enrolled children who have completed 3 or 2 years of treatment and at least one year of post treatment observation in the Sponsor Studies GF 4001 (Safety and Efficacy of Saizen in the Treatment of Young Children Born with Severe IUGR) or GF 6283 (Effect of Intermittent versus Continuous Saizen Therapy in Young Children Born with Severe IUGR), respectively.~Detailed description: Serious IUGR is a syndrome characterized by low birth length and weight for gestational age (less than 10 percentile). The secretion of growth hormone in response to provocative stimuli (e.g. arginine, insulin) is normal in these children. Apart from low birth weight, children born with IUGR may have minor or major malformations.~A catch-up period with a supraphysiological growth velocity generally occurs during the first 6 to 24 months of life in 80 to 90 percent (%) of these children. This generally allows them to reach normal height. That means that conversely, approximately 10 to 20% of children do maintain a statural handicap. Puberty occurs at a normal age and the retardation in bone maturation present during the first years of life disappears very quickly. This leads to short adult stature in subjects who have not shown spontaneous catch-up during the first years of life. A safe and effective means of promoting growth without accelerating the timing or tempo of puberty would therefore be desirable._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Previous inclusion, good compliance and normal completion of GF4001 or GF6283 in the treatment of growth failure in children born with serious IUGR (3-year continuous r-hGH treatment in GF4001 or 2-year continuous or intermittent r-hGH treatment in GF6283).~Increase in height greater than 0.5 standard deviation (SD) during the first 2 years of r-hGH treatment in GF4001 or after 2 years of continuous or intermittent r-hGH treatment in GF6283.~A written Informed Consent at the beginning of the pre-study visit must be obtained from the parent(s)/legal guardian(s), with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject or parents at any time without prejudice to their future medical care.

However, researchers still do not know much about how frequently this long-term side effect may occur and how severe the problem is.~St. Jude Children's Research Hospital researchers want to determine the frequency and severity of this side effect. They are also studying whether taking calcium and Vitamin D supplements can help children at risk for osteoporosis and if certain factors can be identified -- such as age at diagnosis, cancer treatments, or family history -- that may increase the chances of having osteoporosis. Researchers will take an x-ray study called quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to measure bone mineral density (BMD). The BMD is a measure of bone strength. If a subject's BMD falls below the average, he/she will be assigned to one of two groups. Subjects will be randomly assigned (like tossing a coin) to receive calcium and vitamin D pills.

"548","NCT01376778_A Randomized Trial to Prevent Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV)_Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that usually presents with few if any side effects. When first infected, some people may have symptoms similar to mononucleosis (i.e., fatigue, weakness, fever, swollen glands). Most people in the United States are infected during childhood or as adults if they work around children. Pregnant women, who have not been infected with CMV in the past and become infected during pregnancy (i.e. a primary infection), may cause their babies to get infected with CMV. Babies that are infected may develop permanent disabilities including hearing loss and a small portion will die from the infection.~Currently it is not routine practice to screen pregnant women for CMV infection. Additionally, there is no agreement about how to evaluate and manage pregnant women infected with CMV for the first time. There is also no evidence that treatment is beneficial for the baby.~The purpose of this research study is to determine whether treating pregnant women who have a primary CMV infection with CMV antibodies will reduce the number of babies infected with CMV._Female_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Diagnosis of primary maternal CMV infection on the basis of one of the following:~A positive CMV Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody and low-avidity maternal CMV Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody screen~Evidence of maternal seroconversion with development of CMV IgG antibody following a prior negative CMV screen~Gestational age at randomization no later than 23 weeks 6 days based on clinical information and evaluation of the earliest ultrasound; or no later than 27 weeks 6 days for women with a positive IgM, negative IgG initially screened before 23 weeks who are rescreened after 2-4 weeks and have evidence of IgG seroconversion.~Singleton pregnancy.

Fisetin is a natural substance found in strawberries and other foods and is available as a nutritional supplement. Nutritional supplements may be useful in eliminating cells that have undergone a process called senescence. Senescence is when a cell ages and permanently stops dividing but does not die. Over time, large numbers of these cells build up in tissues throughout the body and can release harmful substances that cause inflammation and damage nearby healthy cells.

Clinical evidence indicates potent antagonists of 5-HT2A are more likely to cause hypothermia. Risperidone is a potent 5-HT2A and a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and is proposed to have effect on reduciton of hot flashes through its dopaminergic and serotonergic antagonism. The primary purpose of this study is to determine if RCN3028 is effective and safe in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated.

"602","NCT00618449_Impact of Two Alternative Dosing Strategies for Trachoma Control in Niger_Trachoma is a disease of poverty, which in the hyperendemic areas affects all individuals by the time they are two years old. Active disease is concentrated in children and occurs sporadically in adults. Infection is more widespread. It is anticipated that 25% of the children will be blinded by this disease if they live to be 60 years of age. The blindness rates are higher in women, presumably because of their closer contact with children who can infect them and add to damage from infections the women had while young.~This proposal is to better define how azithromycin in community-based treatment can be used to eliminate blinding trachoma. We will also take the opportunity to join these field studies with genetic epidemiologic studies to better understand the dynamic epidemiology of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in a trachoma endemic area. The empiric data generated from the treatment/follow-up studies, together with the information on sources and spread patterns from genetic epidemiology will be used to generate more robust models to guide future treatment/re-treatment protocols.~We propose to conduct a randomized, community based trial in the Maradi region of Niger to test the hypothesis that two community wide azithromycin treatments, spaced one month apart, are significantly more effective in reducing ocular C. trachomatis infection and trachoma at one year compared to a single mass azithromycin treatment._All_N/A_N/A_Subjects live in a village in Niger that exhibits a high prevalence of clinically active trachoma (>15%) amongst the children living in that village. This prevalence of clinical disease is a marker for much higher infection rates, thus justifying community wide treatment.~Inclusion Criteria:~To be eligible to participate in this study the subject must live in one of the villages selected for this study.~Exclusion Criteria:~All subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria will be excluded from study participation. Exclusion criteria include:~history of allergy to ANY macrolide antibiotic~severe nausea or diarrhea after the first dose of azithromycin~inability to tolerate oral therapy~pre-existing serious illness"

"622","NCT06169215_A Randomized Phase 2 Study of Daratumumab-Selinexor-Velcade-Dexamethasone (Dara-SVD) for High-Risk Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma_This phase II trial compares the combination of selinexor, daratumumab, Velcade (bortezomib), and dexamethasone (Dara-SVD) to the usual treatment of daratumumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (Dara-RVD) in treating patients with high-risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Selinexor is in a class of medications called selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE). It works by blocking a protein called CRM1, which may keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. Daratumumab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called CD38, which is found on some types of immune cells and cancer cells, including myeloma cells. Daratumumab may block CD38 and help the immune system kill cancer cells. Bortezomib blocks several molecular pathways in a cell and may cause cancer cells to die. It is a type of proteasome inhibitor and a type of dipeptidyl boronic acid. Dexamethasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Lenalidomide is in a class of medications called immunomodulatory agents. It works by helping the bone marrow to produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. The drugs daratumumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone and selinexor are already approved by the FDA for use in myeloma. But selinexor is not used until myeloma comes back (relapses) after initial treatment. Giving selinexor in the initial treatment may be a superior type of treatment for patients with high-risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Presence of newly diagnosed (dx) MM as defined by standard International Myeloma working group (IMWG).~Presence of high risk cytogenetics using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) [del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), chromosome 1 abnormalities, MYC translocation, tetrasomies, complex karyotype, high LDH, or extramedullary MM.~Patients are allowed to have received one cycle of bortezomib-based doublet or triplet therapy.

To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.~The effects of selinexor (KPT-330) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because selective nuclear export inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men (with partners of women of childbearing potential) treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of study treatment administration. Adequate contraception should continue for 7 months for females and for 4 months for males after completion of the study treatment.~Female of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating lenalidomide. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 4 weeks before therapy, while taking lenalidomide, during dose interruptions, and for 7 months after study treatment. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks. Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrual bleeding. Lenalidomide treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation.~Men who are sexually active with FCBP must agree to use a latex or synthetic condom while taking lenalidomide, during dose interruptions and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking lenalidomide must abstain from donating blood, semen, or sperm during study participation and for at least 4 weeks after discontinuation from lenalidomide.~Patients who are randomized to receive lenalidomide need to register into the mandatory Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of REMS.~Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Legally authorized representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants.~Exclusion Criteria:~Patients who are in urgent need for MM therapy (such as in the setting of acute kidney injury, or high disease burden concerning for impending organ failure) may begin study treatment immediately after receiving one cycle of bortezomib combination (e.g. bortezomib-dexamethasone or cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone) or one course of pulse dose dexamethasone 20-40mg once daily for four days. No washout period is required.~Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities > grade 1) with the exception of alopecia.~Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.~History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Selinexor (KPT-330) or other agents used in study.~Concomitant medications: Supportive care therapies such as bone directed therapies (zoledronic acid, denosumab), intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) and anti-viral agents are allowed and recommended as per standard of care (SOC). Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and strong CYP3A4 inducers are prohibited, due to their respective increase or decrease in bortezomib exposure. If strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be avoided, then patients will be monitored for signs of bortezomib toxicity and a dose reduction of bortezomib will be considered.~Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any other significant condition(s) that would make participation in this protocol unreasonably hazardous.~Pregnant women are excluded because this study involves an investigational drug that may cause genotoxic, teratogenic, and mutagenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn and drugs that have known genotoxic, teratogenic, or abortifacient effect.~Because there is potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the drugs used in this study, breastfeeding is not allowed during treatment for all drugs and for 2 months after last dose of bortezomib and 1 week after the last dose of selinexor."

"633","NCT03677830_Postoperative Pain Control & Relief in Neonates_Pain control for newborns has made significant improvements over the last 30 years. The use of narcotics remains the standard of care for neonates undergoing minor and major surgeries. Narcotics, however, are associated with adverse effects such as respiratory depression, prolonged intubation and withdrawal symptoms. Acetaminophen (Tylenol©) has been proposed as an adjunct to reduce narcotic use but current evidence from well designed studies in newborns and premature infants is limited. This study will randomly assign neonates undergoing a surgery to either morphine plus acetaminophen or morphine alone for pain control. The subjects will be followed for 72 hours after the operation and evaluate the benefits of acetaminophen for pain control._All_N/A_1 Month_Inclusion Criteria:~All neonates ≥ 28 weeks of gestation and <44 weeks of gestation undergoing general surgery procedures (below) and managed postoperatively in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).~Minor procedures Inguinal hernia repair Laparoscopic or open gastrostomy tube placement Peritoneal drain placement for spontaneous intestinal perforation Gastroschisis bedside patch closure~Major procedures Laparoscopic or open Nissen fundoplication, duodenal atresia repair, Hirschsprung pull through, Ladd's procedure or excision of abdominal cyst Thoracoscopy or thoracotomy procedure Enterostomy or colostomy creation Exploratory laparotomy Revision or closure of enterostomy or colostomy Any Gastroschisis or omphalocele repair in operating room Repair or staged repair of congenital anorectal malformations Resection of sacrococcygeal teratoma~Exclusion Criteria:~Any infant admitted with preoperative diagnosis of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) or known intrauterine opiate exposure~Any diagnosis of hepatitis exclusive of TPN-related biliary cholestasis~Renal disease with creatinine >2.0 mg/dl at enrollment~Intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 or greater, or cerebellar hemorrhage~Any patient with myotonic dystrophy or other congenital disease limiting validity of pain scoring~Opiate exposure within 14 days of operative procedure~Non-English-speaking parents/guardians"

"635","NCT01381120_Therapeutic Merit of Solifenacin in the Mitigation of Ureteral Stent-induced Pain and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) Post Ureteroscopy for Stone Management_Most ureteral stent insertions follow ureteroscopy procedures for stone management. Stents are essentially designed to prevent the blockage of the ureter. Such blockage is often a result of inflammation caused by ureteroscopy procedures. The stent provides a secure passageway for urine as it travels from the kidneys to the bladder, circumventing potential urinary retention. In our community, only one kind of stent is used, and it is manufactured by Bard. Standard protocol involves the removal of the stent 5 to 8 days following insertion. If stenting is required for greater than 8 days, special accommodations will be made for you in this study.~Unfortunately, pain and lower urinary tract symptoms are often associated with the insertion and removal of stents. It is our goal to determine whether VESIcare is capable of relieving such symptoms.~As a prospective member of this study, you will be asked to complete three surveys. The first survey will ask you about your experiences of urinary urgency and pain before your surgery. If you are an emergency patient, you will be asked to remember your condition before the surgery, completing this questionnaire at your first post-op visit. If you are not an emergency patient, this survey will be completed before your surgery. If your stent is removed within 5 to 8 days of surgery, you will be asked to complete the second survey at the time of removal. You will then complete the final survey at a scheduled post-operative check-up 4 to 5 weeks later. If your stent remains inserted for greater than 8 days after surgery, you will be asked to complete the second survey 3 to 4 days after your stent was inserted. You will then complete the final survey, 7 to 8 weeks post-op.~Throughout this study, both VESIcare and non-VESIcare patients will be important in determining whether VESIcare truly is capable of relieving stent pain. As such, you will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups, those receiving VESIcare, and those who are not._All_N/A_N/A_Subject inclusion criteria.~Post-ureteroscopy for stone management.~Stent inserted for more than 5 days.~No significant flank pain or LUTS prior to kidney stones/stent insertion.~Complete agreement with and signing of Informed Consent form.~Subject exclusion criteria.~Significant flank pain or LUTS prior to kidney stones/stent insertion.~Currently taking antimuscarinics or α1 blockers.~Patients with urinary retention, dependent on dialysis, gastroparesis or narrow angle glaucoma."

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as dinutuximab, may induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Eflornithine blocks the production of chemicals called polyamines that are important in the growth of cancer cells.

"643","NCT02780583_Randomized Placebo Controlled Trial of Subcutaneous rhIL-1A (Anakinra) in the Management of Hospitalized Pediatric and Adult Patients With Macrophage Activation Syndrome_The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether giving injections of anakinra is a safe and well tolerated treatment to give as an adjunct to standard prescribed treatment for patients who are admitted to the hospital with signs of severe inflammation (macrophage activation syndrome) that is potentially life-threatening. Anakinra is a commercially available product (Kineret™) approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; it is a replica of a naturally occurring protein called Il-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), made by humans to inhibit and regulate the action of interleukin-1 (IL-1). IL-1 is a mediator of inflammation that when generated in excess amounts by immune system cells can result in severe dysfunction of multiple organs that can be life-threatening. The specific primary objectives of the study are to determine if giving anakinra results in no increased infection complications or mortality. Additional data will be collected to determine whether anakinra administration results in any other unanticipated side effects in this setting, and the effects of anakinra administration on inflammation markers, the overall dose of steroids required to treat the inflammation, and the length of hospital stay._All_1 Year_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:1] Previous diagnosis of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and fulfills the Ravelli criteria (4) for macrophage activation syndrome with either:~two or more Laboratory criteria: 1.

"646","NCT01126957_Combined Ketamine/Propofol for Emergency Department Procedural Sedation_Introduction~Numerous drugs and combinations of drugs are used for procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) in Emergency Departments, including propofol, ketamine, benzodiazepines, narcotics, barbiturates, and others, but propofol has gained popularity despite its potential to cause cardiac and respiratory depression. Obviously the optimal agent or combination of agents has not been identified. There are reasons to believe that a combination of ketamine and propofol may have advantages over other agents/combinations. These include better hemodynamic stability at equal depth of anesthesia with a combination of ketamine/propofol than with propofol alone, less respiratory depression with the combination in comparison to propofol alone, and preservation of respiratory drive with the combination. There is one study of ketamine/propofol in Emergency Department (ED) procedural sedation which demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of the combination, but did not compare it to any other agents or combinations. The investigators designed a randomized, placebo controlled study to compare propofol to propofol and ketamine for adequacy of sedation and respiratory depression in Emergency Department procedural sedation and analgesia. The investigators hypothesis was that the combination of propofol/ketamine would produce better sedation and/or less respiratory depression than propofol alone.~Methods~Study design~The investigators conducted a randomized, prospective, double-blinded study of all patients receiving procedural sedation. From April 2007 until July 2009 in the ED of a 274 bed university teaching hospital. The study was approved by the University of Missouri's Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all participants._All_1 Year_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Healthy individuals from 1 year of age and up without the below exclusion criteria~Exclusion Criteria:~Subjects: All patients who require ED conscious sedation and do not meet any of the following exclusion criteria are eligible for study participation:~Age < 1yr~History of prior adverse reaction to anesthesia~History of cardiac disease~History of pulmonary disease~Hepatic dysfunction~Thyroid disease~Pregnancy~Porphyria~Psychiatric Illness~Allergy to eggs, soybeans, or sulfites~Increased intracranial or intraocular pressure~Active upper respiratory infection in children~Abnormal airway~ASA score of III or greater"
"647","NCT01928446_CSP #590 - Lithium for Suicidal Behavior in Mood Disorders_Observational evidence and findings from clinical trials conducted for other reasons suggest that lithium, a drug used for the treatment of bipolar disorder, and, to a lesser extent, depression, may reduce rates of suicides and suicide attempts. However, this hypothesis has not yet been adequately examined in a randomized clinical trial conducted specifically to test lithium's efficacy in preventing suicides. This clinical trial fills this gap.~This study is feasible within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) because it is a large, integrated health system with existing programs for identifying patients at risk for suicide and delivering enhanced services. In VA, approximately 12,000 patients with depression or bipolar disorder survive a suicide attempt or related behavior each year, and 15% of them repeat within one year. Experimental treatment in this study will supplement usual care for major depression or bipolar disorder, as well as VA's standard, enhanced management for patients at high risk.~The investigators will recruit 1862 study participants, from approximately 30 VA Hospitals. Participants will be patients with bipolar disorder or depression who have survived a recent episode of suicidal self-directed violence or were hospitalized specifically to prevent suicide. Randomly, half will receive lithium, and half will receive placebo. Neither the patients nor their doctors will know whether a particular person has received lithium or placebo. The treatment will be administered and the patients will be followed for one year, after which patients will go back to usual care. Recruitment will occur over 3 years.~The investigators are primarily interested in whether lithium leads to increases in the time to the first repeated episode of suicidal behavior, including suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations specifically to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide. In addition, this study will allow us to explore whether lithium decreases the total number of suicidal behaviors, and whether it has comparable effects on impulsive and non-impulsive behaviors. If there is an effect of lithium, the investigators will be interested in whether or not it could be attributed to improved control of the underlying mental health condition, or, alternatively, whether it represents a direct effect of suicide-related behavior._All_N/A_N/A_Inclusion Criteria:~Must be a Veteran of the United States Armed Forces~Survived an episode of suicidal self-directed violence (including suicide attempts and interrupted attempts) that occurred within six months of admission to the study, or they were admitted within the past six months to a mental health inpatient unit specifically to prevent suicide~Have a diagnosis of an affective disorder meeting DSM-IV-TR (2000) criteria for Bipolar I Disorder, Bipolar II Disorder, or current or recurrent Major Depressive Disorder~Are able and willing to identify one or more family members, friends, or other contacts and give permission for both clinical providers and the Research Team to contact them if the patient cannot be reached~Are able to provide informed consent~There is concurrence from the patient's mental health provider about inclusion/exclusion criteria and confirmation of the providers' willingness to work with the research team in managing the patient during the course of the study.
