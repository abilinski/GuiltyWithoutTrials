Depression in AD patients leads to mental suffering, behavioral disturbance (such as aggression), poor cognition, poor self-care, caregiver depression, caregiver burden, and early entry into the nursing home. Since major depression is treatable, this additional disability may be avoidable. The use of antidepressants to treat major depression in AD is supported by two studies, although a third does not show a benefit for antidepressants over placebo. Also, the safety of antidepressant treatment in depressed AD patients is poorly studied. A conclusive study showing that depression reduction in AD can be accomplished safely with antidepressant medications, and that depression reduction is associated with improvements in activities of daily living, non-mood behavioral disturbances, caregiver burden, and caregiver depression would have major clinical and cost implications for the care of the AD patient. This study is a 13-week, double blind, flexible dose, placebo controlled trial of sertraline in the treatment of outpatients with AD and co-morbid major depression. The hypothesis is that antidepressant treatment is superior to placebo in improving mood, in improving cognition, in reducing physical dependency, in reducing caregiver depression, and in reducing caregiver burden.

To treat this they require medicines to keep their blood pressure high enough to get blood to their bodies. The side effects of these medicines include fast heart rates and increasing the amount of work the heart has to do. Corticosteroids are made by the body and help to use the energy in the food people eat, control the chemicals in their blood and maintain their blood pressure. Corticosteroids made by the body may be decreased in patients that have major surgery. Corticosteroids help to increase blood pressure and can decrease the amount of blood pressure medicines a patient requires. Corticosteroids have been shown to increase blood pressure in patients with bacterial infections and in very small, premature babies but have only been studied in a few babies who have had heart surgery. The way corticosteroids work is unknown but may involve decreasing the body's response to being on a heart-lung machine or give steroids not being made by the patient.~Corticosteroids have been shown to be helpful in treating many diseases. The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of corticosteroids in babies who have had heart surgery and need blood pressure medicines in the intensive care unit after surgery.

It is known that ATIII levels are decreased in normal neonates and infants less than 6 months of age relative to older children and adults and become even further decreased in critically ill neonates and infants, including those with congenital heart disease. The current utilization of ATIII in the context of support on a heart-lung machine is based on pharmacokinetic data derived from adult subjects with congenital ATIII deficiency. There is a gap in knowledge as to the appropriate frequency of ATIII repletion, best method of monitoring, and mode of administration in critically ill neonates and infants receiving support on a heart-lung machine.Our long-term goal is to determine if antithrombin (ATIII) can effectively change the coagulation system in patients undergoing heart-lung machine support. The objective of this proposal, which is our first step in pursuit of that goal, is to determine the pharmacokinetics of ATIII in neonates and infants. Our central hypothesis is that ATIII will have different pharmacokinetic properties in neonates and infants than adults and these properties will be affected by the use of heart-lung machine.~This research will result in critical data on the pharmacokinetics of ATIII in neonates and infants receiving heart-lung machine support.

There are studies using probiotics that have demonstrated a reduction in infection rates in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.~Subjects will be patients at high risk for infection including those with any one or more of the following characteristics: over 65 years old, poor heart function (ejection fraction <40), diabetes (insulin dependant or non-insulin dependant), peripheral vascular disease, kidney dysfunction (creatinine level >2mg/dl), obesity (body surface area > 2 m2), low serum protein levels (albumin < 2.5 mg/dl), infection of the heart valve (endocarditis), or on any antibiotics other than standard prophylaxis before surgery.~The safety of these products has been very well established.~Patients who consent to enter the study will receive the synbiotic mix, or a placebo, which comes in a powder that may be mixed with a drink, or washed down into the stomach through the NG tube if the patient is still on a ventilator.

There are no gender restrictions mentioned, so women can enroll.",TRUE,Evaluation of Routine Administration of Glycerin Suppositories to Improve Bowel Function in Patients With Uncomplicated Gastroschisis,"Gastroschisis is a congenital defect of the abdominal wall that leads to evisceration of various amounts of the abdominal organs. The mainstay of therapy is restoring continuity of the abdominal wall, either through primary closure or with a synthetic graft when primary closure is not feasible.~It has been established that bowel function after repair of gastroschisis is impaired due to the aforementioned pathological processes. Previous studies have shown that the time from surgery to attaining full nutrition through enteral means is a predictor for morbidity in this population. Therefore, numerous therapeutic interventions have been proposed to help hasten bowel function and decrease the time to tolerance of total enteral nutrition. A common, but unproven, technique is the use of glycerin suppositories to stimulate bowel function. The concept of glycerin suppositories is that stimulating colonic activity through the use of the suppository will stimulate small intestinal function. The underlying concept is that improved bowel motility and reduced time to full enteral feeds will reduce the morbidity associated with this disease. While the formation/evacuation of stools is most easily monitored, the main purpose of using these suppositories is to hasten tolerance of nutrition through enteral means.~While the practice of using glycerin suppositories is common in neonates, there is no literature or best-practice guidelines advocating for (or against) their use. A single previous prospective study utilizing glycerin suppositories in premature, low birth weight neonates failed to show any benefit in improving time to tolerate full enteral feeds. At this time, this is the only study investigating the use of glycerin suppositories in any neonatal population, and due to the indications (i.e. premature and low birth weight infants without surgical disease), the findings are not applicable to neonates with gastroschisis. To the authors' knowledge, there are no previous studies or current ongoing studies examining this question. Given this lack of information regarding the efficacy of glycerin suppositories, there is a significant variation in practice among practicing surgeons, including timing of initial administration, frequency of use, and indication to discontinue. Indeed the spectrum ranges from some surgeons who never use glycerin suppositories, to some who prescribe them daily for all gastroschisis patients immediately following surgery.~The purpose of this study will be to determine whether routine use of glycerin suppositories improves bowel function as measured by time to full enteral feeds (primary outcome: defined as enteral feed volume >120mL/kg/day with appropriate weight gain (20-30g/day for two consecutive days)) in neonates with uncomplicated gastroschisis after complete reduction of abdominal viscera.

As Albuterol is not FDA approved for this population (under 2 years) there is no standard recommended dose. Aerosolized Albuterol is one of the most widely used therapies that are utilized for infants with chronic lung disease. The common practice in the N/IICU is weight base dosing of all medications. This contradicts the aerosol science recommendations, which advise not to titrate doses by weight as the patient naturally self-regulates their dose according to the change in minute ventilation with age. In addition, the wide use of aerosolized Albuterol in the infant with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) has little current evidence of efficacy in this disease. Understanding the appropriate dose for effective treatment as well as the indication for use in the BPD population would provide the clinician with useful guidelines.~The investigators propose to analyze the safety and efficacy of aerosolized albuterol in infants with BPD comparing the recommended dose per aerosolization literature with the common dosing practices at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) as well as placebo.",All,N/A,1 Year,"Inclusion Criteria:~Infants greater than or equal to 36 weeks corrected gestational age to one year of age~Diagnosis of BPD in accordance with The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) definition~May have a current order for short acting bronchodilator, not required~May have congenital anomalies unless one or more of the exclusion criteria are met, not required~Receiving conventional mechanical ventilation via an artificial airway (endotracheal tube or tracheostomy) via Draeger V500 Ventilator~Parental/guardian permission (informed consent)~Exclusion Criteria:~Airway leak greater than 10%~Unilateral lung disease~Current order for inhaled anticholinergic (i.e. ipratropium bromide)~Active pulmonary or systemic infection~Scheduled order for other medication that cause bronchodilation (i.e. atrovent, magnesium sulfate, ketamine, etc.)",1

The diaphragmatic defect compromises lung growth and alters pulmonary vascular development. This is reflected postnatally as respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and overall cardiopulmonary dysfunction, particularly post-repair. Currently, optimal management of post-repair PH remains poorly investigated. Sildenafil citrate is a highly selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that increases cGMP levels, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and an anti-proliferative effect within the pulmonary vasculature. It is used off-label for many neonatal PH disorders, including PH associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and idiopathic persistent PH. Most neonates with CDH born within the Mountain West referral basin are managed at a quaternary care center, Primary Children's Hospital (PCH). Of these neonates with PH, approximately 25% have been treated with off-label sildenafil. However, neither the PCH clinical care group nor others have developed/published a standardized approach for either initiating or discontinuing sildenafil therapy in this group of patients. Thus, the aim of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of sildenafil therapy for PH in neonates with CDH within the Utah cohort.

In current clinical practice, patients with invasive lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer subtype.~PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.~Primary Objective:~To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).",Female,N/A,N/A,"Inclusion Criteria:~Histologically confirmed invasive lobular breast cancer, that is hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative, measuring at least 1 centimeter (cm) radiographically or clinically, clinical stages I-III. Invasive lobular histology will be diagnosed at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation. Subsequently, invasive lobular histology will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to patient enrollment.~Prior to initiation of study agents, study participants will be highly encouraged to undergo a baseline research core biopsy of their breast tumor. If this is not possible or the patient refuses, the pre-treatment tumor sample must be obtained from their archival diagnostic core biopsy. If definitive surgery is not performed at day 21-27 after study treatment, a second post-treatment research core biopsy will need to be obtained from their breast tumor. For patients undergoing surgery, the second biopsy will be removed from the breast tumor tissue excised during their operation. Note: In the event that the baseline breast tumor biopsy performed for research purposes does not yield adequate tumor tissue for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints, tissue will be requested from the patient's archival clinical diagnostic core biopsy if it is available.The patient will still remain on study and complete protocol therapy as planned in this unlikely event.~Hormone receptor (HR) status of the invasive component must be documented before trial enrollment. The tumor must be HR-positive. HR will be considered positive if staining is 1% or greater for ER and/or PR. This will be determined at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation and enrollment onto the trial.

The secretion of growth hormone in response to provocative stimuli (e.g. arginine, insulin) is normal in these children. Apart from low birth weight, children born with IUGR may have minor or major malformations.~A catch-up period with a supraphysiological growth velocity generally occurs during the first 6 to 24 months of life in 80 to 90 percent (%) of these children. This generally allows them to reach normal height. That means that conversely, approximately 10 to 20% of children do maintain a statural handicap. Puberty occurs at a normal age and the retardation in bone maturation present during the first years of life disappears very quickly. This leads to short adult stature in subjects who have not shown spontaneous catch-up during the first years of life.

Researchers will take an x-ray study called quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to measure bone mineral density (BMD). The BMD is a measure of bone strength. If a subject's BMD falls below the average, he/she will be assigned to one of two groups. Subjects will be randomly assigned (like tossing a coin) to receive calcium and vitamin D pills.

Depression is a very common symptom of AD, affecting as many as 50% of patients over their illness. Depression in AD (Alzheimer's disease) contributes greatly to patient disability and caregiver distress. Neither psychosocial interventions nor psychotropic medications have proven effective to date for the treatment of depression in AD.Venlafaxine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depression but it is not known whether or not it can help depression in Alzheimer's Disease.",All,N/A,N/A,"Inclusion Criteria:~Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Diploma in Social Medicine (DSM)-IV (TR) criteria (90), with a Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) (82) score of 10-26 inclusive;~Depression as defined by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Consensus Criteria,~Clinical Dementia Rating Scale of 1 mild or 2 moderate.
