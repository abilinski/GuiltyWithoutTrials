NCT03895099,1,"The objective of this study is to show that treatments can be simplified without reducing the number of oocytes that have been punctured, by blocking the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge by using oral progesterone and by limiting the number of injections of gonadotropins using corifollitropin alpha, regardless of the start date of the pacing protocol during a natural cycle.","The study focuses on optimizing ovarian stimulation regimens for oocyte donors, which is directly related to assisted reproductive techniques and fertility treatments."

The participants are specifically those trying to conceive through assisted reproductive techniques.

NCT02317809,1,Some women cannot have children because they cannot produce enough follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH). When this happens the ovaries fail to produce an egg during the menstrual cycle - a condition known as anovulation. Anovulation can be treated by giving replacement FSH and LH. Pergoveris is a medication that contains both FSH and LH. It is used for the treatment of anovulation in women who do not produce enough FSH and LH.,"The study involves testing a new formulation of Pergoveris, a medication used to treat anovulation in women who cannot produce enough FSH and LH, which is directly related to infertility treatment."

NCT01144416,1,"The purpose of this study is to show that a single injection of SCH 900962/MK-8962 is non-inferior to daily injections of recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (recFSH) during the first week of ovarian stimulation in terms of the number of vital pregnancies (ie, presence of at least one fetus with heart activity as assessed by ultrasound at least 35 days after embryo transfer) in women aged 35 to 42 years undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).","The study investigates the efficacy and safety of a drug to induce multifollicular development for controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing IVF or ICSI, which are assisted reproductive techniques aimed at promoting conception."

NCT00868140,1,Our hypothesis is that hyperinsulinemia increases the renal clearance of D-chiro-inositol (DCI) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and that this leads to a reduction in circulating insulin-stimulated D-chiro-inositol-containing inositol phosphoglycan (DCI-IPG) release.,"The study focuses on women with PCOS, a condition often associated with infertility. The intervention aims to improve insulin sensitivity, which can potentially enhance fertility in these women."

It involves testing a new protocol using fertility drugs to stimulate egg production and hormone regulation, specifically targeting women with conditions that affect their natural hormone levels."

This 16 week period of lifestyle modification will be followed by an open label empiric infertility treatment regimen consisting of three cycles of ovarian stimulation with oral medication (clomiphene citrate (CC)), triggering of ovulation with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and intrauterine insemination (IUI).","The study focuses on women with obesity and unexplained infertility, aiming to improve reproductive fitness through lifestyle modification and subsequent infertility treatment, including ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination (IUI)."
